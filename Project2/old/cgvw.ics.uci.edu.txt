		The Future of Research in Computer Games and Virtual Worlds	

	
	
	
		
In November of 2010, more than 30 scholars engaged in research on topics related to Computer Games and Virtual?Worlds (CGVWs) participated in a workshop at UC Irvine to identify future research problems and?opportunities in this arena. During the past year and a half the workshop continued online, culminating in the production of an extensive report characterizing this dynamic field of study. The report is now freely available!
What follows is the executive summary of this report.

More than 30 scholars engaged in research on topics related to Computer Games and Virtual Worlds (CGVWs) participated in a workshop to identify future research problems and opportunities in this arena. Six working group topics were identified based on the scholarship?and interests of the invited participants. The groups were then tasked to meet, discuss, and debate their respective topics, the results of which appear as the first six chapters of this?report. The six CGVW chapter topics are:
Computer Systems Technologies for CGVWs¡ªmulti-core and many core processors,?computer graphics hardware and software, networking, databases, language design,?sensors, etc.Advanced GGVW Technologies¡ªAI, behavioral scripting, narrative and emergent?systems, procedural and non-procedural content generation, avatar generation and?customization, world building kits, etc.Media, Art, Culture and History of CGVWs¡ªCGVWs as media, art, literature and?expressive forms of social critique; new literacies, creativity with or through CGVW, etc.Anthropological, Behavioral, Sociological Studies of CGVWs¡ªethnographic studies of?CGVWs, work-versus-play or work-as-play or play-as-work, patterns of migration across?CGVWs, CGVW in complex enterprise settings, research methods for studying CGVWs.Education and Learning with CGVWs¡ªhow CGVW sfacilitate or inhibit learning in formal?or informal education settings, play as learning, CGVWs for STEM and Humanities?learning, etc.CGVWs for Science, Health, Environment, Energy, Defense¡ªCGVWs as research tools or?infrastructure for R&D in other scientific, industrial, or government domains, etc.
Each chapter addresses a common set of concerns including current research findings,?emerging research problems of high consequence, future research infrastructure needs, and?broader impacts arising from research investments in each of the six topic areas. Contributors to these chapters represent a diverse set of scholars and disciplines that might?not otherwise be drawn together. No effort was directed to integrating the results presented?across the chapters, so each chapter can be read and reviewed standalone, though better if?reviewed comparatively across chapters.
The report also identifies overall observations that advocate investment in future CGVW research.?Their intent is to be bold and stimulating. These observations are summarized as follows.
CGVWs as new media and technologies of practice have the potential to pervade most, if not all,?sectors of scientific research, technology development, educational and cultural practices in?industry, academia, and government. CGVWs are not a ¡°killer app,¡± but instead CGVWs are more?likely the next Web: a new layer of systems and applications that can cross social, organizational,?institutional and technological boundaries, just like the World-Wide Web has done over the past?15 or so years.
CGVWs are not about mere ¡°gamification¡± by which we mean turning existing socio-technical ?systems into those where users simply earn virtual badges, points, or prizes for accomplished ?game play. Instead, CGVWs are rich socio-technical systems that can facilitate creativity, new ?cultural practices, new educational opportunities, and new ways and means for stimulating research and higher education in the sciences, health, and related disciplines.
CGVWs are embracing the next-generation workforce of those who will seek to work in the ?various MACH, SHEED, ABS, and advanced IT disciplines, industries or government agencies. ?Market research figures suggest that at least one billion people world-wide are now playing and ?interacting through CGVWs. Investments in STEM education do not yet address this, nor do ?current R&D investments across government agencies identify this situation.
The U.S. currently leads the global development of new CGVW-centered products and services.?Such socio-economic condition and market leadership can be accelerated through investment in a new CGVW research agenda, such as that identified in this report. New firms and highly skilled ?jobs will emerge through such investments into CGVW research, as can new markets.
Future research in CGVWs can be targeted to different research agencies and research ?programs that can maximize interests through targeted investments. Games for health care ?represents one such application domain for focused CGVW research. Games for health may be ?able to provide a new way and means for facilitating self-managed chronic care ailments that can ?be personally rewarding as well as transformative¡ªnot in the sense of curing the ailment, but in the sense of making the ailment amenable to personal activity and self-care more manageable.
Research in CGVWs overlaps most areas of current interest that advance the overall science ?research agenda for networked information technology (NITRD 2012). Massively multi-user CGVWs represent new venues for communication and social interaction that generate big data about social, behavioral, cultural, and technological practice, all data that characterize societal processes. New research challenge problems like reanimating the visible human can generate new scientific knowledge from domains that link or converge across nanotechnology, biology, information technology, and cognitive science (NBIC) disciplines.
The industries currently vested in CGVWs as entertainment media are not leading the way in pushing the R&D horizons identified in this report. Without coordination of research investment, CGVW technology will emerge as disjoint, islands of automation that will become evermore complex and costly to integrate for mutual benefit.
This report identified six related areas that would benefit from strategic or programmatic R&D investments. The national NITRD (2012) agenda and grand challenge problem domains are both amenable to be favorably advanced through investment in CGVW research. In particular, the NITRD Program and this report put forward recommendations for a planning and coordination support request whose structure provides a model for what, where, how, when, and why to invest in to strategically stimulate CGVW research (NITRD 2012, pp. 19-20): Co-funding testbeds, infrastructures, and advanced tools/instrumentation for experimentation with new CGVW technologies; Workshops that mobilize and bring together researchers, program managers, and socio-economic leaders; Collaborative deployment of new CGVW system infrastructures, tools, repositories/archives across R&D programs; Interagency cooperation to focus research investment that identify and provide solutions to challenges in mission-oriented SHEED programs; Technical standards for interoperable, scalable, secure, and scalable CGVW systems and infrastructures; Testbeds that enable the joint R&D experimentation, crowdsourcing, and decentralized study of CGVWs; and a Science and Technology Steering Council.
Overall, CGVWs are an engine of innovation: one that can stimulate the production of new knowledge and practice in multiple scientific, creative, cultural, educational and IT-centered disciplines, industries, and government agencies. CGVWs are emerging as socio-technical ecosystems for addressing problems in areas such as education, socio-economic development, health care, and scientific research. This statement is based not on speculation, but on diverse R&D results, projects, and expertise cited in this report and beyond (see Steinkuehler Squire 2011). CGVWs represent transformative technologies and socio-economic practices whose time is coming, and whose opportunity to strategically invest is near at hand. If the purpose of careful and cautious investment of limited public funds is to realize the greatest benefits to many diverse public and private interests, then CGVW merits serious attention, consideration, and commitment of resources that can fuel this engine of innovation. Such engines of growth and prosperity are uncommon and often elusive. Keep this new engine of innovation well fueled and fund its improvement.

UCI, which is already outfitted with a Center for Computer Games and Virtual Worlds meant to expand research into those fields, will now let undergraduate students major in Computer Game Science after final approval was granted during a divisional Senate assembly meeting.


 Here¡¯s a description of the major, courtesy of UC Irvine:
¡°The Computer Game Science (CGS) major combines a solid foundation in computer science with a focus on designing, building, and understanding computer games and other forms of interactive media. 
¡°The fundamentals of information and computer science, along with coursework in mathematics, statistics, physics, and film and media studies, provide students with the concepts and tools to study a wide scope of computer game technologies. CGS emphasizes design, teamwork, and the understanding of computer games and related technologies and media in a social and cultural context.
¡°The study of computer games is an emerging field that is driven by advancing computer hardware and software technology, the widespread popularity of video games as an entertainment medium, and by the interest of artists, economists, educators, scientists and many others, to use game technologies for communication, visualization, computation and learning.¡±
This fall, freshman students who have already been accepted to UCI will be able to change their major, said Andre van der Hoek, associate dean of student affairs, in an e-mail. Transfer students will be allowed to major in the program in 2012.

Q: How has the online gaming community been transformed by MMORPGs like World of Warcraft?
A: WoW is proof that online video games can appeal to a wide variety of demographic groups beyond the first-person shooters, which are primarily the province of young men. WoW has a healthy number of female players ¨C about 20 percent ¨C and people of all ages. In my guild, or club, is a man with five grandchildren, a 16-year-old boy and everything in between.
Activities within the game are also unusually diverse. You can play by yourself or with others. You can engage in quests, which are short mini-games, or join in raids in which 10 to 25 players collaborate in difficult battles that may take weeks to win. Some people enjoy the economics in the game and play the Auction House. It¡¯s up to the player. From a research point of view, the diversity is interesting but also a challenge, because it¡¯s hard to generalize about 11.5 million players.
Q: How do online character interactions differ from face-to-face interactions?
A: In situations where people play with those they don¡¯t know (some contests throw together ad hoc teams), individuals often behave badly under cover of anonymity ¨C nerd rage. But frequently people play with real-life friends and family, and interactions are governed by standard rules of good conduct.
In between is an interesting twilight area in which you interact with people you know pretty well in-game, such as guild mates, but probably won¡¯t ever meet in real life. Behaviors that would be inappropriate at school or work, such as sexualized and scatalogical talk or outrageous flirtation, are permissible and common. Players stretch the boundaries of conventional good taste, taking advantage of what play theorists call the ¡°magic circle¡± that allows us to abandon certain rules of ordinary existence.
Q: What key differences did you observe between U.S. and Chinese players?
A: The most important finding from my research is that play in the U.S. and China is remarkably similar. Players in both countries like WoW graphics, the sociable experience it offers and the challenge of the contests. The game¡¯s cross-cultural appeal demonstrates the power of software to shape human activity, a subject I go into in depth in my book.
However, there are some differences: In China, people often play in Internet cafes, or wang ba. A significant face-to-face component to game play is part of the experience, and it occurs in a public space. Sometimes people meet new people in wang ba, and sometimes they go with their friends. My very first interview in China was with a group of five young men who were playing WoW together and planned to go to dinner afterwards. If you see someone playing WoW and would like to sit next to him or her so you can talk about the game, you can ask another patron to change seats. Play combines the real and the virtual.
Another difference is the reluctance of Chinese males to play female characters. In the U.S., males often play female characters because they like the way they look. In China, such players are called ¡°lady boys,¡± akin to transvestites ¨C and that¡¯s not a compliment. Female players in both countries nearly always play female characters. In China, they must sometimes explain that they are not ¡°lady boys.¡± They seem to take this in good grace.
Q: Are these cultural differences?
A: The ¡°lady boy¡± meme can be said to be cultural. In interviews, Chinese players reported that it¡¯s ¡°natural¡± for men and women to be different and that this difference should be respected. In this context, we can construe culture as representing habitual, persistent patterns of thought and activity.
But regarding wang ba ¨C is that culture? Wang ba play produces a distinctive gaming experience, but people often play there because they don¡¯t have a good computer at home or because they live in cramped quarters with their parents until marriage. Still, some players said they chose wang ba because they liked the social experience, so it¡¯s complicated. Cultural difference is a notion to be approached cautiously; differences are often more a function of economic and political realities.
Q: Do you plan to continue as a Night Elf Priest in the upcoming Cataclysm expansion of WoW?
A: Yes. I have tried many types of characters, and priest is still my favorite. I enjoy healing because my actions affect the characters of other players, not just the game monsters. I have preview access to Cataclysm and have created the cutest goblin ever! She¡¯s a shaman, which is like a sturdier priest. I continue to play in order to observe historical transformation in the game ¨C in particular, issues of governance between Blizzard and the player community. WoW is a kind of mini-culture ¨C one controlled in large part through software ¨C with its own history and unique dynamics.

After a week spent building a computer game from scratch, Justin Britch is sitting behind a laptop Monday night just five hours from an 11 p.m. deadline.
¡°We couldn¡¯t get our levels to work for a very long time,¡± Britch tells Reza Ghassemi, president of UC Irvine¡¯s Video Game Development Club.
¡°For how long?¡± asks Ghassemi.
¡°Are they working now?¡± Britch asks his teammates.
No, half the levels still don¡¯t work.
Britch, 19 and a resident of Mission Viejo, is participating in his second ¡°Game Jam,¡± a week-long marathon competition put on by the university¡¯s gaming club pitting teams of computer science, art and informatics majors working around the clock against one another to build computer games.

		Studying Computer Games Is No Waste

¡°Most people have to work for a living; others get to play video games.¡± That is what United States Senator Tom Coburn, M.D. (R-OK) said about research at UC Irvine¡¯s Center for Computer Games and Virtual Worlds in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science.
The Center for Computer Games and Virtual Worlds is truly interdisciplinary, as befits a research area having broad social impact, with faculty not just from the fields of informatics and computer science but also humanities, law, education, art and anthropology. So it would be fair to say they do a whole lot more than just play video games there.
But last December, Coburn published ¡°Wastebook 2010: A Guide to Some of the Most Wasteful Government Spending of 2010¡± through his taxpayer-funded senatorial office.? In it, he ranked as No. 6 (out of 100 government-funded projects) work by UCI Professor Bonnie Nardi, Senior Research Scientist Walt Scacchi and 21 other researchers, for which they received a three-year, $3 million grant from the National Science Foundation in 2008.

UC Irvine¡¯s New Computer-Games Major Gets Its Game On
The school is banking big on computer games as an emerging discipline
By MICHELLE WOO Thursday, Dec 9 2010


Open House Night remains a standard of American higher education, an opportunity for colleges and universities to convince prospective students and skeptical parents why their institutions are the best, why the parents should spend the next four to five years scrounging to pay tens of thousands of dollars in tuition, why the student must enroll in that program and ignore the competition. Administrators and professors pull out all the proverbial stops to impress recruits, from spending thousands on glossy packets to name-dropping prominent alumni to offering tours of grandiose campus architecture and boasting about the assured millions in salary that will inevitably come after graduation.
But for UC Irvine¡¯s computer-game-science major, the pitch is simple: computer screens. With computer games loaded onto them. There they are¡ªtake them.

		Navarro, Van der Hoek win Premier Award for SimSE	

	
	
	
		Project scientist Emily Navarro and Associate Dean Andr¨¦ van der Hoek have been recognized with the 2009 Premier Award for SimSE, a game-based educational software engineering simulation environment that allows students to practice ¡°virtual¡± software engineering processes in a graphical, interactive and fun setting.
SimSE¡¯s direct, graphical feedback enables students to learn the complex cause and effect relationships underlying software engineering processes. During the game, the student takes on the role of the project manager and directs engineers to perform typical process tasks.
SimSE helps bridge the gap between the conceptual knowledge about software engineering that is presented in lecture but that      often times is not fully explored or practiced in assignments or projects.

SimSE includes a customizable modeling environment that allows instructors to create new scenarios, application domains, organizations and cultures. SimSE has been used worldwide and has been found to be an educationally effective tool that increases students¡¯ understanding of software engineering process concepts.
Van der Hoek¡¯s research focuses on understanding and advancing the role of design, coordination, and education in software engineering. He has authored and co-authored over 80 peer-reviewed journal and conference publications, and in 2006 was a recipient of an ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award. He is a co-author of the 2005 Configuration Management Impact Report as well as the 2007 Futures of Software Engineering Report on Software Design and Architecture.

		LA Times: UC Irvine takes video games to the next level	

	
	
	
		
By Tony Barboza,
November 30, 2009
UC Irvine has long sought to be known for preeminence in fields such as engineering, medicine and business. But now the university is embracing a new discipline: video games.
Once ridiculed within university halls as merely a nerdy pastime, computer games are being promoted to a full-fledged academic program at the Irvine campus, a medium as ripe for study as the formats before it: film, radio and television.
This fall UC Irvine established the Center for Computer Games & Virtual Worlds, and construction is underway on a 4,000-square-foot, 20-room ¡°Cyber-Interaction Observatory¡± for faculty research. Plans call for floor-to-ceiling projection screens, 3-D stereoscopic displays and gesture-based interfaces.
If all goes according to plan, next fall UC Irvine will debut a four-year undergraduate program allowing students to declare ¡°game science¡± as their major ¡ª an idea that drew snickers when a few professors first proposed it a decade ago.
¡°There are people who will say we¡¯re pandering to a trend,¡± said Dan Frost, an informatics lecturer who teaches a popular computer game development course. ¡°But this really is intellectually justified. Universities are always doing things that seem crazy at first.¡±
It¡¯s a fitting development for a campus where some students are so gaga for gaming that they spend sleepless nights writing code for their homespun games and like to unwind with pizza-fueled Street Fighter tournaments and Rock Band contests. Continue reading ¡°LA Times: UC Irvine takes video games to the next level¡±

		Lopes speaks at Intel CTO  keynote address	

	
	
	
		Cristina Lopes, Associate Professor of Informatics participated as a guest speaker in the keynote address at SuperComputing ¡¯09 in Portland Oregon.? The Keynote was delivered by Justin Rattner, CTO of Intel.? Lopes was a guest at Rattner¡¯s keynote, in her role as one of the main architects of OpenSim.
Justin Rattner¡¯s opening keynote address at SuperComputing¡¯09 message addressed how the super-computing industry has stagnated, and the only thing that will save it from collapse is a drastic change on what people think of as ¡°super-computing.¡± Other guests were Aaron Duffy, a biology researcher at Utah State University, and Shenlei Winkler, CEO of the Fashion Design Institute.
Lopes¡¯ research is related to languages and communication systems. The ultimate goal of her research is to deepen the knowledge about communication, in particular in systems that involve humans and machines. With this utopic goal in mind, she has done work in a variety of fields such as programming languages, security and applications of audio signal processing.

¡°For how long?¡± asks Ghassemi.
¡°Are they working now?¡± Britch asks his teammates.
No, half the levels still don¡¯t work.
Britch, 19 and a resident of Mission Viejo, is participating in his second ¡°Game Jam,¡± a week-long marathon competition put on by the university¡¯s gaming club pitting teams of computer science, art and informatics majors working around the clock against one another to build computer games.

Though the games are simple, mostly two dimensional with flat maps and relatively simple multicolored animated characters, the third ¡°Game Jam¡± competition held by the club is an opportunity for budding artists, game designers and programmers to add a finished product to their portfolio. And they do it in just a week while experiencing what it¡¯s like to work and collaborate on a project.
With video game giant Blizzard Entertainment nearby, UC Irvine is seeing an increase in the prominence of video game development. The school introduced a new major, computer game science, in fall 2010 but too late to be promoted to prospective students. Britch is among around 40 students already accepted to the university who switched majors once he found out it was offered.
Now the degree program is being actively marketed and more than 400 applications were received for the fall 2011 quarter, according to Walt Scacchi, director of research at the university¡¯s Computer Games and Virtual Worlds Center. A similar major, computer game design, was introduced at UC Santa Cruz in 2006, and the number of students majoring in the degree now outnumber those majoring in general computer science.
¡°When we talked to undergraduate computer science majors already here in the university and asked them what they want to do¡­when they graduate ¨C the vast majority ¨C 70, 80 or 90 percent ¨C have said they¡¯d really like to get a job in the game industry,¡± said Scacchi. ¡°That¡¯s without there being a Computer Game Science major.¡±
The Video Game Development Club held three of these ¡°Game Jams,¡± the first only having two teams, the second having four and the third with five teams. Meetings for the club have gone from occupying a corner of a computer lab with a little more than a dozen people to filling a room with 30 to 40 people.
Some teams in the ¡°Game Jam¡± competition work remotely using instant messaging and email to coordinate the project, while others spend time ¨C a lot of time ¨C working together at the university.
Ryan Sharpe, a 2008 UCI alumnus, was the producer for his team and spent around 110 hours with them through the course of the week, much of it in a Donald Bren Hall computer lab stricken with poor ventilation, as well as a bevy of heat-producing laptops, computers and warm bodies coding for a week.
He described part of his job as being about supplying food, with frequent trips to nearby In-N-Out and avoiding the ¡°clich¨¦¡± of Mountain Dew and pizza, as well as blankets and pillows when team members got tired.
Four fans, and propping the doors open help alleviate the heat as recycle bins filled up with empty soda cans.
Benches outside the lab doubled as beds for overnight work on weekends.
¡°You have to put the hours in. Games don¡¯t just happen when you have an idea,¡± said Sharpe.
A freshman, Britch did level design as part of Sharpe¡¯s team during the last ¡°Game Jam¡± on a game that ultimately won the competition. He had planned to come to the university as a physics major until he realized he actually hated the subject as a senior in high school. He found out UCI offered the computer game science major and picked it up as a placeholder, thinking he¡¯d switch to engineering.
¡°Then I realized this is what I want to do,¡± he said.
With the 11 p.m. deadline approaching Britch¡¯s team finally got the levels working at 10:30 p.m., one of the last things they did.
¡°I walked around to each individual person and asked them. ¡®Is this in the game? Is this in the game? And just ran down the checklist to make sure we didn¡¯t forget anything,¡± he said.
They did forget something.
Around 10:45 p.m. they realized the project left out sound effects, three hours of Britch¡¯s work left on the cutting room floor. Instead of missing the deadline they submitted as is, with 10 minutes to spare.
¡°There¡¯s only so much you can do,¡± said Britch.
Another team, besieged by technical problems, didn¡¯t finish in time and was disqualified.
Apart from the experience, the grand prize is a poster on the wall of the gaming lab in Donald Bren Hall naming them as winners.
¡°I plan on doing this every time they offer it,¡± said Britch.
You can try out the games for yourself, though I can¡¯t guarantee how well any of these will work and they should only work on a PC:
Rainbow Dice Games: Camera Obscura (.zip file)
Chocolate Factory: Gnome Man¡¯s Land (.zip file)
Team Dark Force: Fairy Frenzy (.exe file)
Nocturnal Games: The Way of Shadows (.zip file)

¡°Most people have to work for a living; others get to play video games.¡± That is what United States Senator Tom Coburn, M.D. (R-OK) said about research at UC Irvine¡¯s Center for Computer Games and Virtual Worlds in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science.
The Center for Computer Games and Virtual Worlds is truly interdisciplinary, as befits a research area having broad social impact, with faculty not just from the fields of informatics and computer science but also humanities, law, education, art and anthropology. So it would be fair to say they do a whole lot more than just play video games there.
But last December, Coburn published ¡°Wastebook 2010: A Guide to Some of the Most Wasteful Government Spending of 2010¡± through his taxpayer-funded senatorial office.? In it, he ranked as No. 6 (out of 100 government-funded projects) work by UCI Professor Bonnie Nardi, Senior Research Scientist Walt Scacchi and 21 other researchers, for which they received a three-year, $3 million grant from the National Science Foundation in 2008.

		UC Irvine establishes Center for Computer Games and Virtual Worlds	

	
	
	
		  
CGVW Director of Research, Walt Scacchi (above)
It will join forces with Institute for Software Research and Game Culture & Technology Laboratory
UC Irvine¡¯s Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Sciences has established the Center for Computer Games & Virtual Worlds, led by ICS Associate Dean Magda El Zarki and senior research scientist Walt Scacchi of the UCI Institute for Software Research.
The center¡¯s goal is to expand campuswide research activities that draw upon UCI¡¯s strengths spanning the social and technological aspects of games and virtual worlds. More than 20 faculty members from computer science, arts, humanities, social science and education will collaborate in the center.

UCI was among the first major research universities to establish educational and research programs in computer game culture and technology. The UCI Game Culture & Technology Lab, launched in 2001, has attracted nearly $5 million in external funding.
¡°We now realize that scientific and cultural achievements go beyond the current concepts of what games and virtual worlds are good for, or how they may be developed or applied,¡± Scacchi said. ¡°The center will support our research in demonstrating the sustained ability to invent and reinvent the future of computer games and virtual worlds.¡±
UCI has a growing number of game-related research projects, including game-based virtual worlds where students ¡°play to learn¡± via interactive simulations, open community-based development of games and synthetic worlds, and gamelike synthetic worlds where autonomous characters display emotional responses and emergent behaviors.
The Center for Computer Games & Virtual Worlds plans to host national and international research workshops as well as visiting research scholars. In addition, center faculty plan to establish industry and academic partnerships with computer game and virtual world research centers across the globe.

¡°Most people have to work for a living; others get to play video games.¡± That is what United States Senator Tom Coburn, M.D. (R-OK) said about research at UC Irvine¡¯s Center for Computer Games and Virtual Worlds in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science.
The Center for Computer Games and Virtual Worlds is truly interdisciplinary, as befits a research area having broad social impact, with faculty not just from the fields of informatics and computer science but also humanities, law, education, art and anthropology. So it would be fair to say they do a whole lot more than just play video games there.
But last December, Coburn published ¡°Wastebook 2010: A Guide to Some of the Most Wasteful Government Spending of 2010¡± through his taxpayer-funded senatorial office.? In it, he ranked as No. 6 (out of 100 government-funded projects) work by UCI Professor Bonnie Nardi, Senior Research Scientist Walt Scacchi and 21 other researchers, for which they received a three-year, $3 million grant from the National Science Foundation in 2008.

The first thing you should think when someone tells you that a federal education, art or science grant is ¡°waste¡± is that that person has no idea what they are talking about. Each of those institutions depends on an extensive peer-review process to choose the best from among a vast number of grant proposals. There are proposals calling for far more money than is available in the budget, and the process is extremely competitive.? To receive even a modest NSF grant is a mark of distinction, to be granted millions of dollars is an unmistakable sign of scientific merit.
The second thing to keep in mind is that Senator Coburn is not trying to change the grant-making decision process, apart from using political intimidation to apply some ¡°chilling effect¡± over topics he dislikes. What he wants is for Congress to slash the budget of the NSF, National Endowment for the Arts, Department of Education, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and every other non-military institution of the American government. The figure he cites in the introduction of his ¡°wastebook¡± is the 40 percent reduction made in 1946. Those federal grants provide a major portion of UCI¡¯s budget, particularly since research is such a big part of our mission here. One reason research is important to life at UCI is that 53 percent of those federal grants comes off the top to pay for ¡°overhead¡± like our buildings and subsidized tuition.
Some have suggested that Senator Coburn, born in 1948, just does not ¡°get it¡± when it comes to understanding how important computer games and virtual worlds are to the modern economy and the future of business innovation. That maybe he and his people are unaware that gross sales by the video game industry surpassed that of the movie industry in 2008.? Perhaps they are unaware that Irvine is the home of more than 40 companies in the computer game business. The largest of those companies is Blizzard Entertainment, creator of ¡°World of Warcraft,¡± which has 1,400 of its 6,000-strong global work force located here. Or that video game sales, unlike those in many other entertainment industries, have historically grown even during recessions.
Busy senator that he is, we would certainly be understanding if he did not know that UCI takes computer games so seriously that we just started offering a major in computer game science last fall.? Of course he is not be the only person who has trouble grasping the nature of this culturally transformative new technology.? The computer games major took 10 years of concerted effort to bring to fruition and encountered, and no doubt will continue to encounter, difficulties with perception by, and preconceived notions from, people who are not knowledgeable about the field.? This is a process that so clearly echoes the establishment of film studies and film schools in the 20th century that one could get the impression that the statements have been copied and pasted with some of the names switched around.
The tough question here is what to do when you witness this kind of ignorant or deceptive attack, especially when it comes from a powerful person or group. I do not think trying to run around and correct all the falsehoods and omissions is worthwhile. Few people have the patience or inclination to listen, and besides, that would mean always being on the defensive. One thing that will help is to be alert and be prepared to think critically when presented with political messages. Every undergraduate here must satisfy the university writing requirement, which means you have learned something about rhetorical analysis ? or you will. Use those skills! Even on texts where you do not know what to think. Perhaps especially on texts where you agree without having to think.
One last bit of advice. Think about what you do here at UCI and why it is important to you, your family and our community. Be prepared to share what that is with anyone who will listen and do so when the opportunity arises. If you do not think that your being here is worthwhile, then that is the real waste.

UC Irvine¡¯s New Computer-Games Major Gets Its Game On
The school is banking big on computer games as an emerging discipline
By MICHELLE WOO Thursday, Dec 9 2010


Open House Night remains a standard of American higher education, an opportunity for colleges and universities to convince prospective students and skeptical parents why their institutions are the best, why the parents should spend the next four to five years scrounging to pay tens of thousands of dollars in tuition, why the student must enroll in that program and ignore the competition. Administrators and professors pull out all the proverbial stops to impress recruits, from spending thousands on glossy packets to name-dropping prominent alumni to offering tours of grandiose campus architecture and boasting about the assured millions in salary that will inevitably come after graduation.
But for UC Irvine¡¯s computer-game-science major, the pitch is simple: computer screens. With computer games loaded onto them. There they are¡ªtake them.

On a recent Saturday afternoon, dozens of high-school seniors sat in front of computer screens at UCI¡¯s Donald Bren Hall, clicking, clacking and staring, trying out the creations of current Anteaters.
One is entranced by Angry Hand of God, in which players become the ruler of the heavens and must strike things on Earth¡ªcars, buildings, gas stations, mortals¡ªwith a lightning-bolt-shooting finger. Another furiously moves his mouse trying to guard an atomic nucleus under attack by dangerous radiation particles in the game Nucleon. Around the corner, a group stares with mouths half-open at a gleaming, multimonitor display showing Colossal Crisis; players are gathering various parts to build a robot that will take on a giant monster destroying the city.
In this game lab, one volunteer sits with a brainwave-reading apparatus hooked to his head, while another shows off a driving game that¡¯s built like an ATV and can drive on real roads. As current students chat about the many games they¡¯ve developed and designed¡ªdemoed on sleek, black, 40-inch flat-screen monitors lining the walls¡ªwide-eyed parents stammer out words of awe.
¡°I can¡¯t believe it!¡±
¡°We¡¯re old!¡±
¡°This is the future!¡±
Their children, mostly messy-haired boys wearing untucked T-shirts and holding cans of Coke and Mountain Dew, smile and nod in shy approval. This is home.
Once seen on college campuses as a nerdy pastime that invaded residence halls late into the night, taking young scholars away from books, computer games are now considered a serious discipline, one that captures the interest of scholars across the globe and the deep pockets of the multibillion-dollar computer-gaming industry. As the medium expands to encompass everything from blockbuster epics to Angry Birds, UCI is trying to soar along with it, establishing the Center for Computer Games & Virtual Worlds, planning a Cyber-Interaction Observatory for faculty research, and¡ªthis fall¡ªintroducing an undergraduate computer-game-science major with a curriculum rooted in computer science and rounded off with art, history and culture. In an era in which colleges are largely cutting back on curricula and disciplines, the school boldly pushes ahead.
¡°There were people who thought, ¡®Why games? This is not something that should be taught at a major university,¡¯¡± explains Magda El Zarki, a computer-science professor and the director of the center. ¡°Why not? Games are becoming the technology used in education, medicine, job training. The U.S. Army uses games to train soldiers; surgeons and nurses use them to prepare for traumatic scenarios. They¡¯re not just something teen boys play after-hours.¡±
Savvy students, born with controller-tapping thumbs, see opportunity in an industry that¡¯s expected to generate a global revenue of $68.3 billion by 2012, according to data from PriceWaterhouseCoopers¡¯ latest Global Entertainment and Media Outlook. The average salary for computer-game programmers last year was $80,320, not including bonuses and stock options that can add thousands more. The biggest-budget games can call for more than 100 developers and years of work.
The parents might still view what¡¯s in front of them in disbelief, but the teens understand this isn¡¯t a mere trend.
¡°That would be the same as saying books are a trend or movies are a trend,¡± says Justin Britch, a UCI freshman currently enrolled in the program. ¡°It¡¯s the next form of media that¡¯s just going to keep growing. When people think of games, they think of, like, Xbox. But soon, it¡¯s gonna be like, ¡®Here¡¯s a video game for teachers. Here¡¯s a game to help people with depression.¡¯¡±
Britch sits behind an information table with his friend and classmate Jon Lee. Both 18 years old and from Mission Viejo, they wear navy polo shirts embroidered with the game-science-major mascot, the spiky-haired main character from Colossal Crisis. The two discuss what led them to the discipline.
Britch, who knew he wanted to go into computer programming, says he¡¯d long been interested in altering games, signing into online forums to learn how it was done.
For Lee, the direction was a surprising one. He considered careers in music and aerospace engineering before receiving in April a ¡°life-changing¡± e-mail from the associate dean for student affairs at the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences that informed prospective students, ¡°Computer Game Science is a newly approved major that was not yet an option at the time you submitted your UC application.¡±

		The Future of Research in Computer Games and Virtual Worlds	

	
	
	
		
In November of 2010, more than 30 scholars engaged in research on topics related to Computer Games and Virtual?Worlds (CGVWs) participated in a workshop at UC Irvine to identify future research problems and?opportunities in this arena. During the past year and a half the workshop continued online, culminating in the production of an extensive report characterizing this dynamic field of study. The report is now freely available!
What follows is the executive summary of this report.

		Navarro, Van der Hoek win Premier Award for SimSE	

	
	
	
		Project scientist Emily Navarro and Associate Dean Andr¨¦ van der Hoek have been recognized with the 2009 Premier Award for SimSE, a game-based educational software engineering simulation environment that allows students to practice ¡°virtual¡± software engineering processes in a graphical, interactive and fun setting.
SimSE¡¯s direct, graphical feedback enables students to learn the complex cause and effect relationships underlying software engineering processes. During the game, the student takes on the role of the project manager and directs engineers to perform typical process tasks.
SimSE helps bridge the gap between the conceptual knowledge about software engineering that is presented in lecture but that      often times is not fully explored or practiced in assignments or projects.

After a week spent building a computer game from scratch, Justin Britch is sitting behind a laptop Monday night just five hours from an 11 p.m. deadline.
¡°We couldn¡¯t get our levels to work for a very long time,¡± Britch tells Reza Ghassemi, president of UC Irvine¡¯s Video Game Development Club.
¡°For how long?¡± asks Ghassemi.
¡°Are they working now?¡± Britch asks his teammates.
No, half the levels still don¡¯t work.
Britch, 19 and a resident of Mission Viejo, is participating in his second ¡°Game Jam,¡± a week-long marathon competition put on by the university¡¯s gaming club pitting teams of computer science, art and informatics majors working around the clock against one another to build computer games.

		LA Times: UC Irvine takes video games to the next level	

	
	
	
		
By Tony Barboza,
November 30, 2009
UC Irvine has long sought to be known for preeminence in fields such as engineering, medicine and business. But now the university is embracing a new discipline: video games.
Once ridiculed within university halls as merely a nerdy pastime, computer games are being promoted to a full-fledged academic program at the Irvine campus, a medium as ripe for study as the formats before it: film, radio and television.
This fall UC Irvine established the Center for Computer Games & Virtual Worlds, and construction is underway on a 4,000-square-foot, 20-room ¡°Cyber-Interaction Observatory¡± for faculty research. Plans call for floor-to-ceiling projection screens, 3-D stereoscopic displays and gesture-based interfaces.
If all goes according to plan, next fall UC Irvine will debut a four-year undergraduate program allowing students to declare ¡°game science¡± as their major ¡ª an idea that drew snickers when a few professors first proposed it a decade ago.
¡°There are people who will say we¡¯re pandering to a trend,¡± said Dan Frost, an informatics lecturer who teaches a popular computer game development course. ¡°But this really is intellectually justified. Universities are always doing things that seem crazy at first.¡±
It¡¯s a fitting development for a campus where some students are so gaga for gaming that they spend sleepless nights writing code for their homespun games and like to unwind with pizza-fueled Street Fighter tournaments and Rock Band contests. Continue reading ¡°LA Times: UC Irvine takes video games to the next level¡±

		Navarro, Van der Hoek win Premier Award for SimSE	

	
	
	
		Project scientist Emily Navarro and Associate Dean Andr¨¦ van der Hoek have been recognized with the 2009 Premier Award for SimSE, a game-based educational software engineering simulation environment that allows students to practice ¡°virtual¡± software engineering processes in a graphical, interactive and fun setting.
SimSE¡¯s direct, graphical feedback enables students to learn the complex cause and effect relationships underlying software engineering processes. During the game, the student takes on the role of the project manager and directs engineers to perform typical process tasks.
SimSE helps bridge the gap between the conceptual knowledge about software engineering that is presented in lecture but that      often times is not fully explored or practiced in assignments or projects.

		LA Times: UC Irvine takes video games to the next level	

	
	
	
		
By Tony Barboza,
November 30, 2009
UC Irvine has long sought to be known for preeminence in fields such as engineering, medicine and business. But now the university is embracing a new discipline: video games.
Once ridiculed within university halls as merely a nerdy pastime, computer games are being promoted to a full-fledged academic program at the Irvine campus, a medium as ripe for study as the formats before it: film, radio and television.
This fall UC Irvine established the Center for Computer Games & Virtual Worlds, and construction is underway on a 4,000-square-foot, 20-room ¡°Cyber-Interaction Observatory¡± for faculty research. Plans call for floor-to-ceiling projection screens, 3-D stereoscopic displays and gesture-based interfaces.
If all goes according to plan, next fall UC Irvine will debut a four-year undergraduate program allowing students to declare ¡°game science¡± as their major ¡ª an idea that drew snickers when a few professors first proposed it a decade ago.
¡°There are people who will say we¡¯re pandering to a trend,¡± said Dan Frost, an informatics lecturer who teaches a popular computer game development course. ¡°But this really is intellectually justified. Universities are always doing things that seem crazy at first.¡±
It¡¯s a fitting development for a campus where some students are so gaga for gaming that they spend sleepless nights writing code for their homespun games and like to unwind with pizza-fueled Street Fighter tournaments and Rock Band contests. Continue reading ¡°LA Times: UC Irvine takes video games to the next level¡±

		Lopes speaks at Intel CTO  keynote address	

	
	
	
		Cristina Lopes, Associate Professor of Informatics participated as a guest speaker in the keynote address at SuperComputing ¡¯09 in Portland Oregon.? The Keynote was delivered by Justin Rattner, CTO of Intel.? Lopes was a guest at Rattner¡¯s keynote, in her role as one of the main architects of OpenSim.
Justin Rattner¡¯s opening keynote address at SuperComputing¡¯09 message addressed how the super-computing industry has stagnated, and the only thing that will save it from collapse is a drastic change on what people think of as ¡°super-computing.¡± Other guests were Aaron Duffy, a biology researcher at Utah State University, and Shenlei Winkler, CEO of the Fashion Design Institute.
Lopes¡¯ research is related to languages and communication systems. The ultimate goal of her research is to deepen the knowledge about communication, in particular in systems that involve humans and machines. With this utopic goal in mind, she has done work in a variety of fields such as programming languages, security and applications of audio signal processing.

		UCI students could soon major in video games	

	
	
	
		The Orange County Register¡¯s Ian Hamilton on the new Center for Computer Games and Virtual Worlds:
IRVINE Freshmen at UC Irvine could be among the first graduates to earn a degree in computer game science as the university expands its research into gaming and virtual worlds.
A new Center for Computer Games and Virtual Worlds established this quarter at UCI is expected to consolidate and expand the research done in those fields. UCI isn¡¯t the first school to offer a degree program in computer gaming, but university officials are keen on turning informal relationships faculty have with video game development companies into formal ones that can lead to internships, scholarships and exclusive research and development agreements. One of the most popular games in the world, World of Warcraft, is made by Irvine-based Blizzard Entertainment and a number of students from UCI already work there, said Information and Computer Sciences associate dean Magda El Zarki.

UC Irvine¡¯s New Computer-Games Major Gets Its Game On
The school is banking big on computer games as an emerging discipline
By MICHELLE WOO Thursday, Dec 9 2010


Open House Night remains a standard of American higher education, an opportunity for colleges and universities to convince prospective students and skeptical parents why their institutions are the best, why the parents should spend the next four to five years scrounging to pay tens of thousands of dollars in tuition, why the student must enroll in that program and ignore the competition. Administrators and professors pull out all the proverbial stops to impress recruits, from spending thousands on glossy packets to name-dropping prominent alumni to offering tours of grandiose campus architecture and boasting about the assured millions in salary that will inevitably come after graduation.
But for UC Irvine¡¯s computer-game-science major, the pitch is simple: computer screens. With computer games loaded onto them. There they are¡ªtake them.

		LA Times: UC Irvine takes video games to the next level	

	
	
	
		
By Tony Barboza,
November 30, 2009
UC Irvine has long sought to be known for preeminence in fields such as engineering, medicine and business. But now the university is embracing a new discipline: video games.
Once ridiculed within university halls as merely a nerdy pastime, computer games are being promoted to a full-fledged academic program at the Irvine campus, a medium as ripe for study as the formats before it: film, radio and television.
This fall UC Irvine established the Center for Computer Games & Virtual Worlds, and construction is underway on a 4,000-square-foot, 20-room ¡°Cyber-Interaction Observatory¡± for faculty research. Plans call for floor-to-ceiling projection screens, 3-D stereoscopic displays and gesture-based interfaces.
If all goes according to plan, next fall UC Irvine will debut a four-year undergraduate program allowing students to declare ¡°game science¡± as their major ¡ª an idea that drew snickers when a few professors first proposed it a decade ago.
¡°There are people who will say we¡¯re pandering to a trend,¡± said Dan Frost, an informatics lecturer who teaches a popular computer game development course. ¡°But this really is intellectually justified. Universities are always doing things that seem crazy at first.¡±
It¡¯s a fitting development for a campus where some students are so gaga for gaming that they spend sleepless nights writing code for their homespun games and like to unwind with pizza-fueled Street Fighter tournaments and Rock Band contests.

		Navarro, Van der Hoek win Premier Award for SimSE	

	
	
	
		Project scientist Emily Navarro and Associate Dean Andr¨¦ van der Hoek have been recognized with the 2009 Premier Award for SimSE, a game-based educational software engineering simulation environment that allows students to practice ¡°virtual¡± software engineering processes in a graphical, interactive and fun setting.
SimSE¡¯s direct, graphical feedback enables students to learn the complex cause and effect relationships underlying software engineering processes. During the game, the student takes on the role of the project manager and directs engineers to perform typical process tasks.
SimSE helps bridge the gap between the conceptual knowledge about software engineering that is presented in lecture but that      often times is not fully explored or practiced in assignments or projects.

		UCI students could soon major in video games	

	
	
	
		The Orange County Register¡¯s Ian Hamilton on the new Center for Computer Games and Virtual Worlds:
IRVINE Freshmen at UC Irvine could be among the first graduates to earn a degree in computer game science as the university expands its research into gaming and virtual worlds.
A new Center for Computer Games and Virtual Worlds established this quarter at UCI is expected to consolidate and expand the research done in those fields. UCI isn¡¯t the first school to offer a degree program in computer gaming, but university officials are keen on turning informal relationships faculty have with video game development companies into formal ones that can lead to internships, scholarships and exclusive research and development agreements. One of the most popular games in the world, World of Warcraft, is made by Irvine-based Blizzard Entertainment and a number of students from UCI already work there, said Information and Computer Sciences associate dean Magda El Zarki.

		LA Times: UC Irvine takes video games to the next level	

	
	
	
		
By Tony Barboza,
November 30, 2009
UC Irvine has long sought to be known for preeminence in fields such as engineering, medicine and business. But now the university is embracing a new discipline: video games.
Once ridiculed within university halls as merely a nerdy pastime, computer games are being promoted to a full-fledged academic program at the Irvine campus, a medium as ripe for study as the formats before it: film, radio and television.
This fall UC Irvine established the Center for Computer Games & Virtual Worlds, and construction is underway on a 4,000-square-foot, 20-room ¡°Cyber-Interaction Observatory¡± for faculty research. Plans call for floor-to-ceiling projection screens, 3-D stereoscopic displays and gesture-based interfaces.
If all goes according to plan, next fall UC Irvine will debut a four-year undergraduate program allowing students to declare ¡°game science¡± as their major ¡ª an idea that drew snickers when a few professors first proposed it a decade ago.
¡°There are people who will say we¡¯re pandering to a trend,¡± said Dan Frost, an informatics lecturer who teaches a popular computer game development course. ¡°But this really is intellectually justified. Universities are always doing things that seem crazy at first.¡±
It¡¯s a fitting development for a campus where some students are so gaga for gaming that they spend sleepless nights writing code for their homespun games and like to unwind with pizza-fueled Street Fighter tournaments and Rock Band contests.
¡°People go to school to become painters,¡± said James Dalby, 30, a senior information and computer science major and vice president of the campus game development club. ¡°Well, companies need that kind of skill to dream up all the fantastic worlds that they¡¯re going to make into a virtual reality.¡±
The Irvine campus is one of a number of schools expanding offerings aimed at a generation that grew up well after the advent of Pac-Man and Pong.
¡°They¡¯re so used to playing with computers that they get bored stiff with plain old textbooks,¡± said Magda El Zarki, a computer science professor and director of the center.
Computer game studies are growing in popularity at other universities. USC, for instance, admitted 31 students this fall majoring in computer science (games).
But the cadre of video game fanatics behind UCI¡¯s new center, including dozens of students and 20 faculty members from different disciplines, has had to battle an obvious perception: that what they¡¯re studying is just fun and games.
Not everyone, after all, sees the analysis of Halo or Half-Life as a legitimate academic pursuit.
A decade ago, computer science instructors at UC Irvine who tried to get approved a minor in computer games were laughed at and the idea was shot down. But now, whatever hesitation there was seems to have faded, at least within academia.
Faculty members have had success in winning research funding, though at times the awards have caused outsiders to shake their heads.
When UC Irvine researchers were awarded a $100,000 federal grant last year from the National Science Foundation to study the differences in how gamers from the U.S. and China play World of Warcraft, Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) held it up as an example of fiscal irresponsibility in a report called ¡°2008: Worst Waste of the Year.¡±
Yet the school has persisted, courting industry partners and raising millions of dollars in corporate funding and federal grants to study computer games and ¡°virtual worlds,¡± or simulations that can be used for everything from stroke rehabilitation to courtroom reenactments.
¡°A lot of people, when they hear ¡®games¡¯ and ¡®university,¡¯ they see nothing in common,¡± said Walt Scacchi, a senior research scientist who helped found UCI¡¯s Game Culture and Technology Lab in 2001. ¡°They think games are mindless and not something to be studied seriously. Like many new disciplines, there¡¯s often a high degree of skepticism.¡±
But the appeal of video game studies is broad,  attracting even studio art majors such as 22-year-old Joel Youkhanna.
He transferred to UC Irvine because it was one of only a few schools that offer gaming as a course of study.
¡°I like coming up with ideas, characters and stories,¡± he said. ¡°That¡¯s what drew me to the world of video games.¡±
And now that he¡¯s a few months shy of graduating with a concentration in game culture and technology, he¡¯s hoping to find work at a major game company.
He smiles when asked if he ever thought he could turn a hobby into a college degree.
¡°I actually have a lot of friends who are really jealous of what I¡¯m doing,¡± he said.
In Frost¡¯s 10-week computer game course, students work in small teams to create a short game for a PC or cellphone. It could be a puzzle, a role-playing game, a jumping-based ¡°platform game¡± or a first-person shooter.
One of the games students have collaborated on is Colossal Crisis, in which students under attack by Godzilla have to collect debris to bring back to their professor in order to build a robot to defeat the monster.
Frost is thinking about using the game¡¯s characters as mascots to announce the new major.
He and other faculty believe video game studies are gaining acceptance, despite the naysaying.
¡°When people first started studying film at USC, I¡¯m sure people were like, ¡®C¡¯mon!¡¯ ¡± Frost said. ¡°People said it isn¡¯t serious. The attitude has changed.¡±
So in his course, Frost sometimes picks apart just a few minutes of a computer game like a film professor would classic cinema.
¡°Let¡¯s see how that sequence of cuts worked,¡± Frost often tells his students. ¡°It¡¯s like listening to Beethoven¡¯s Fifth in a music appreciation class.¡±
UC Irvine sees the program as a natural fit for Southern California, home to dozens of video game companies such as Activision Blizzard, which created the popular Call of Duty and World of Warcraft from corporate offices in Irvine and Santa Monica.
And the school plans to maintain a tight link with the industry by inviting professionals to give presentations as well as send students on tours of local game studios.
That exposure could help students make the transition from seeing gaming as a hobby to viewing it as a career.
¡°It¡¯s not a bunch of nerds clamoring around a dark basement,¡± said Dalby, of the game development club. ¡°It¡¯s actually an office environment of people that have jobs and benefits and are really interested in what they do.¡±
As administrators wrangle for lab space to dedicate to gaming, students do most of their work ¡ª and play ¡ª on their personal laptops.
The center doesn¡¯t yet have a physical location, after all.
¡°I guess,¡± Frost said, ¡°it¡¯s the virtual world.¡±

		Studying Computer Games Is No Waste	

	
	
	
		Jim White | Feb 01, 2011 | Comments 1
¡°Most people have to work for a living; others get to play video games.¡± That is what United States Senator Tom Coburn, M.D. (R-OK) said about research at UC Irvine¡¯s Center for Computer Games and Virtual Worlds in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science.
The Center for Computer Games and Virtual Worlds is truly interdisciplinary, as befits a research area having broad social impact, with faculty not just from the fields of informatics and computer science but also humanities, law, education, art and anthropology. So it would be fair to say they do a whole lot more than just play video games there.
But last December, Coburn published ¡°Wastebook 2010: A Guide to Some of the Most Wasteful Government Spending of 2010¡± through his taxpayer-funded senatorial office.? In it, he ranked as No. 6 (out of 100 government-funded projects) work by UCI Professor Bonnie Nardi, Senior Research Scientist Walt Scacchi and 21 other researchers, for which they received a three-year, $3 million grant from the National Science Foundation in 2008.

UC Irvine¡¯s New Computer-Games Major Gets Its Game On
The school is banking big on computer games as an emerging discipline
By MICHELLE WOO Thursday, Dec 9 2010


Open House Night remains a standard of American higher education, an opportunity for colleges and universities to convince prospective students and skeptical parents why their institutions are the best, why the parents should spend the next four to five years scrounging to pay tens of thousands of dollars in tuition, why the student must enroll in that program and ignore the competition. Administrators and professors pull out all the proverbial stops to impress recruits, from spending thousands on glossy packets to name-dropping prominent alumni to offering tours of grandiose campus architecture and boasting about the assured millions in salary that will inevitably come after graduation.
But for UC Irvine¡¯s computer-game-science major, the pitch is simple: computer screens. With computer games loaded onto them. There they are¡ªtake them.

		Navarro, Van der Hoek win Premier Award for SimSE	

	
	
	
		Project scientist Emily Navarro and Associate Dean Andr¨¦ van der Hoek have been recognized with the 2009 Premier Award for SimSE, a game-based educational software engineering simulation environment that allows students to practice ¡°virtual¡± software engineering processes in a graphical, interactive and fun setting.
SimSE¡¯s direct, graphical feedback enables students to learn the complex cause and effect relationships underlying software engineering processes. During the game, the student takes on the role of the project manager and directs engineers to perform typical process tasks.
SimSE helps bridge the gap between the conceptual knowledge about software engineering that is presented in lecture but that      often times is not fully explored or practiced in assignments or projects.

		LA Times: UC Irvine takes video games to the next level	

	
	
	
		
By Tony Barboza,
November 30, 2009
UC Irvine has long sought to be known for preeminence in fields such as engineering, medicine and business. But now the university is embracing a new discipline: video games.
Once ridiculed within university halls as merely a nerdy pastime, computer games are being promoted to a full-fledged academic program at the Irvine campus, a medium as ripe for study as the formats before it: film, radio and television.
This fall UC Irvine established the Center for Computer Games & Virtual Worlds, and construction is underway on a 4,000-square-foot, 20-room ¡°Cyber-Interaction Observatory¡± for faculty research. Plans call for floor-to-ceiling projection screens, 3-D stereoscopic displays and gesture-based interfaces.
If all goes according to plan, next fall UC Irvine will debut a four-year undergraduate program allowing students to declare ¡°game science¡± as their major ¡ª an idea that drew snickers when a few professors first proposed it a decade ago.
¡°There are people who will say we¡¯re pandering to a trend,¡± said Dan Frost, an informatics lecturer who teaches a popular computer game development course. ¡°But this really is intellectually justified. Universities are always doing things that seem crazy at first.¡±
It¡¯s a fitting development for a campus where some students are so gaga for gaming that they spend sleepless nights writing code for their homespun games and like to unwind with pizza-fueled Street Fighter tournaments and Rock Band contests. Continue reading ¡°LA Times: UC Irvine takes video games to the next level¡±

		Lopes speaks at Intel CTO  keynote address	

	
	
	
		Cristina Lopes, Associate Professor of Informatics participated as a guest speaker in the keynote address at SuperComputing ¡¯09 in Portland Oregon.? The Keynote was delivered by Justin Rattner, CTO of Intel.? Lopes was a guest at Rattner¡¯s keynote, in her role as one of the main architects of OpenSim.
Justin Rattner¡¯s opening keynote address at SuperComputing¡¯09 message addressed how the super-computing industry has stagnated, and the only thing that will save it from collapse is a drastic change on what people think of as ¡°super-computing.¡± Other guests were Aaron Duffy, a biology researcher at Utah State University, and Shenlei Winkler, CEO of the Fashion Design Institute.
Lopes¡¯ research is related to languages and communication systems. The ultimate goal of her research is to deepen the knowledge about communication, in particular in systems that involve humans and machines. With this utopic goal in mind, she has done work in a variety of fields such as programming languages, security and applications of audio signal processing.

		UCI students could soon major in video games	

	
	
	
		The Orange County Register¡¯s Ian Hamilton on the new Center for Computer Games and Virtual Worlds:
IRVINE Freshmen at UC Irvine could be among the first graduates to earn a degree in computer game science as the university expands its research into gaming and virtual worlds.
A new Center for Computer Games and Virtual Worlds established this quarter at UCI is expected to consolidate and expand the research done in those fields. UCI isn¡¯t the first school to offer a degree program in computer gaming, but university officials are keen on turning informal relationships faculty have with video game development companies into formal ones that can lead to internships, scholarships and exclusive research and development agreements. One of the most popular games in the world, World of Warcraft, is made by Irvine-based Blizzard Entertainment and a number of students from UCI already work there, said Information and Computer Sciences associate dean Magda El Zarki.

      I joined ICS in
the Fall of 2002. Prior to being in ICS, I was a Research Scientist at
the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.
While at PARC, I am most known as a founder of the group that
developed Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) and started
aspectj.org. My interests have expanded considerably since then. To
find out about my current projects and students, follow the links on
the left or visit the mondego

      I have B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical and
Computer Engineering from 
Instituto Superior T¨¦cnico, in Lisbon, and a Ph.D.
in Computer Science from Northeastern
University, in Boston. I also studied piano and voice, and
have sung in choirs such as the San
Francisco Symphony Chorus (1999-2002) and the Gulbenkian
Choir (1989-1992).   I received a National Science
Foundation's CAREER Award, 2004-2009.  I'm 
Erdos number 3 (Erdos -> Specker -> Lieberherr
-> me).

        S. Dumais, E. Cutell, J. Cadiz, G. Jancke, R. Sarin, and D. Robbins,
        SIGIR, 2003

        Commentary: "This paper addresses an increasingly important problem
        - how to search and manage personal collections of electronic
        information. ... it addresses an important user-centered problem.
        ...this paper presents a practical user interface to make the system
        useful. ..., the paper includes large scale, user-oriented testing that
        demonstrates the efficacy of the system. ..., the evaluation uses both
        quantitative and qualitative data to make its case. I think this paper
        is destined to be a classic because it may eventually define how people
        manage their files for a decade. Moreover, it is well-written and can
        serve as a good model for developers doing system design and

	4. "Simple,

        Commentary: "This paper provides a brief but well informed and
        technically accurate overview of the state of the art in text
        retrieval, at least up to 1997. It introduces the ideas of terms and
        matching, term weighting strategies, relevance weighting, a little on

        does an exemplary job of introducing the terminology of IR and the main
        issues in text retrieval for a numerate and technically well informed
        audience. It also has a very well chosen list of references."

        Sivakumar, A. Tomkins, E. Upfal, PODS 2000 (*)

        Abstract: "The pages and hyperlinks of the World-Wide Web may be
        viewed as nodes and edges in a directed graph. This graph has about a
        billion nodes today, several billion links, and appears to grow
        exponentially with time. There are many reasons -- mathematical,
        sociological, and commercial -- for studying the evolution of this graph.
        We first review a set of algorithms that operate on the Web graph,
        addressing problems from Web search, automatic community discovery, and
        classification. We then recall a number of measurements and properties
        of the Web graph. Noting that traditional random graph models do not
        explain these observations, we propose a new family of random graph
        models."

        Brin and L. Page (this link is to the long version, the short version
        was publishied in WWW1998)(*) 

        Commentary: "This paper (and the work it reports) has had more
        impact on everyday life than any other in the IR area. A major
        contribution of the paper is the recognition that some relevant search
        results are greatly more valued by searchers than others. By reflecting
        this in their evaluation procedures, Brin and Page were able to see the
        true value of web-specific methods like anchor text. The paper presents
        a highly efficient, scalable implementation of a ranking method which
        now delivers very high quality results to a billion people over
        billions of pages at about 6,000 queries per second. It also hints at
        the technology which Google users now take for granted: spam rejection,
        high speed query-based summaries, source clustering, and
        context(location)-sensitive search. IR and bibliometrics researchers
        had done it all (relevance, proximity, link analysis, efficiency,
        scalability, summarization, evaluation) before 1998 but this paper
        showed how to make it work on the web. For any non-IR engineer
        attempting to build a web-based retrieval system from scratch, this
        must be the first port of call."

        11. "Indexing
        by latent semantic analysis" by (Deerwester, Dumais, et.al) (*)

        Commentary: " IR, as a field, hasn't directly considered the issue
        of semantic knowledge representation. The above paper is one of the few
        that does in the following way. LSI is latent semantic analysis (LSA)
        applied to document retrieval. LSA is actually a variant of a growing
        ensemble of cognitively-motivated models referred to by the term
        "semantic space". LSA has an encouraging track record of compatibility
        with human information processing across a variety of information
        processing tasks. LSA seems to capture the meaning of words in a way
        which accords with the representations we carry around in our heads.
        Finally, the above paper is often cited and interest in LSI seems to
        have increased markedly in recent years. The above paper has also made
        an impact outside our field. For example, recent work on latent
        semantic kernels (machine learning) draws heavily on LSI. "

        retrieval, but also attempts to make some sense of the information as
        well."

Academic Honesty

I trust all students are honest and do not cheat. Those who break my trust
at any point will get an F in the course - no excuses or apologies will be
accepted.Additional penalties may also be imposed by the
department and the university. Very severe incidents of academic dishonesty can
result in suspension or expulsion from the university. 

So don't risk it! If, for some reason, you can't do the homework on time or
can't study for the Quiz, you're better off skipping it than cheating it. Do
the math!


Students with Disability

Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the
impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss his or her
specific needs. Also contact the Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494
as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented
in a timely fashion.

	On Tuesday, 1/29 Prof. Chen Li will share his experiences
	  of doing search-related research and commercializing the results.  The
	  work is mainly conducted in the iPubmed project
	  (http://ipubmed.ics.uci.edu), which can support instant, fuzzy search
	  on more than 21 million medical publications.  He has been doing a
	  startup, called SRCH2, to commercialize the techniques.  The company
	  has spent the last few years developing a new full text search
	  software from the ground up.  Here are some of the things SRCH2 can
	  do: it resides wholly in-memory, deploys multi-threaded queries, uses
	  cached forward indexing to enable instant recommendations, does rapid
	  geo search, error correction, customizable rankings, with real-time
	  updates, all in parallel, in scale. Each feature addresses significant

Academic Honesty

I trust all students are honest and do not cheat. Those who break my trust
at any point will get an F in the course - no excuses or apologies will be
accepted.Additional penalties may also be imposed by the
department and the university. Very severe incidents of academic dishonesty can
result in suspension or expulsion from the university. 

So don't risk it! If, for some reason, you can't do the homework on time or
can't study for the Quiz, you're better off skipping it than cheating it. Do
the math!

CHAPTER 5
Representational State Transfer (REST)

This chapter introduces and elaborates the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems, describing the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, while contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. REST is a hybrid style derived from several of the network-based architectural styles described in Chapter 3 and combined with additional constraints that define a uniform connector interface. The software architecture framework of Chapter 1 is used to define the architectural elements of REST and examine sample process, connector, and data views of prototypical architectures.
5.1 Deriving REST

The design rationale behind the Web architecture can be described by an architectural style consisting of the set of constraints applied to elements within the architecture. By examining the impact of each constraint as it is added to the evolving style, we can identify the properties induced by the Web's constraints. Additional constraints can then be applied to form a new architectural style that better reflects the desired properties of a modern Web architecture. This section provides a general overview of REST by walking through the process of deriving it as an architectural style. Later sections will describe in more detail the specific constraints that compose the REST style.
5.1.1 Starting with the Null Style

There are two common perspectives on the process of architectural design, whether it be for buildings or for software. The first is that a designer starts with nothing--a blank slate, whiteboard, or drawing board--and builds-up an architecture from familiar components until it satisfies the needs of the intended system. The second is that a designer starts with the system needs as a whole, without constraints, and then incrementally identifies and applies constraints to elements of the system in order to differentiate the design space and allow the forces that influence system behavior to flow naturally, in harmony with the system. Where the first emphasizes creativity and unbounded vision, the second emphasizes restraint and understanding of the system context. REST has been developed using the latter process. Figures 5-1 through 5-8 depict this graphically in terms of how the applied constraints would differentiate the process view of an architecture as the incremental set of constraints is applied.

The Null style (Figure 5-1) is simply an empty set of constraints. From an architectural perspective, the null style describes a system in which there are no distinguished boundaries between components. It is the starting point for our description of REST.



5.1.2 Client-Server

The first constraints added to our hybrid style are those of the client-server architectural style (Figure 5-2), described in Section 3.4.1. Separation of concerns is the principle behind the client-server constraints. By separating the user interface concerns from the data storage concerns, we improve the portability of the user interface across multiple platforms and improve scalability by simplifying the server components. Perhaps most significant to the Web, however, is that the separation allows the components to evolve independently, thus supporting the Internet-scale requirement of multiple organizational domains.



5.1.3 Stateless

We next add a constraint to the client-server interaction: communication must be stateless in nature, as in the client-stateless-server (CSS) style of Section 3.4.3 (Figure 5-3), such that each request from client to server must contain all of the information necessary to understand the request, and cannot take advantage of any stored context on the server. Session state is therefore kept entirely on the client.




This constraint induces the properties of visibility, reliability, and scalability. Visibility is improved because a monitoring system does not have to look beyond a single request datum in order to determine the full nature of the request. Reliability is improved because it eases the task of recovering from partial failures [133]. Scalability is improved because not having to store state between requests allows the server component to quickly free resources, and further simplifies implementation because the server doesn't have to manage resource usage across requests.

Like most architectural choices, the stateless constraint reflects a design trade-off. The disadvantage is that it may decrease network performance by increasing the repetitive data (per-interaction overhead) sent in a series of requests, since that data cannot be left on the server in a shared context. In addition, placing the application state on the client-side reduces the server's control over consistent application behavior, since the application becomes dependent on the correct implementation of semantics across multiple client versions.
5.1.4 Cache

In order to improve network efficiency, we add cache constraints to form the client-cache-stateless-server style of Section 3.4.4 (Figure 5-4). Cache constraints require that the data within a response to a request be implicitly or explicitly labeled as cacheable or non-cacheable. If a response is cacheable, then a client cache is given the right to reuse that response data for later, equivalent requests.




The advantage of adding cache constraints is that they have the potential to partially or completely eliminate some interactions, improving efficiency, scalability, and user-perceived performance by reducing the average latency of a series of interactions. The trade-off, however, is that a cache can decrease reliability if stale data within the cache differs significantly from the data that would have been obtained had the request been sent directly to the server.

The early Web architecture, as portrayed by the diagram in Figure 5-5 [11], was defined by the client-cache-stateless-server set of constraints. That is, the design rationale presented for the Web architecture prior to 1994 focused on stateless client-server interaction for the exchange of static documents over the Internet. The protocols for communicating interactions had rudimentary support for non-shared caches, but did not constrain the interface to a consistent set of semantics for all resources. Instead, the Web relied on the use of a common client-server implementation library (CERN libwww) to maintain consistency across Web applications.




Developers of Web implementations had already exceeded the early design. In addition to static documents, requests could identify services that dynamically generated responses, such as image-maps [Kevin Hughes] and server-side scripts [Rob McCool]. Work had also begun on intermediary components, in the form of proxies [79] and shared caches [59], but extensions to the protocols were needed in order for them to communicate reliably. The following sections describe the constraints added to the Web's architectural style in order to guide the extensions that form the modern Web architecture.
5.1.5 Uniform Interface

The central feature that distinguishes the REST architectural style from other network-based styles is its emphasis on a uniform interface between components (Figure 5-6). By applying the software engineering principle of generality to the component interface, the overall system architecture is simplified and the visibility of interactions is improved. Implementations are decoupled from the services they provide, which encourages independent evolvability. The trade-off, though, is that a uniform interface degrades efficiency, since information is transferred in a standardized form rather than one which is specific to an application's needs. The REST interface is designed to be efficient for large-grain hypermedia data transfer, optimizing for the common case of the Web, but resulting in an interface that is not optimal for other forms of architectural interaction.




In order to obtain a uniform interface, multiple architectural constraints are needed to guide the behavior of components. REST is defined by four interface constraints: identification of resources; manipulation of resources through representations; self-descriptive messages; and, hypermedia as the engine of application state. These constraints will be discussed in Section 5.2.
5.1.6 Layered System

In order to further improve behavior for Internet-scale requirements, we add layered system constraints (Figure 5-7). As described in Section 3.4.2, the layered system style allows an architecture to be composed of hierarchical layers by constraining component behavior such that each component cannot "see" beyond the immediate layer with which they are interacting. By restricting knowledge of the system to a single layer, we place a bound on the overall system complexity and promote substrate independence. Layers can be used to encapsulate legacy services and to protect new services from legacy clients, simplifying components by moving infrequently used functionality to a shared intermediary. Intermediaries can also be used to improve system scalability by enabling load balancing of services across multiple networks and processors.




The primary disadvantage of layered systems is that they add overhead and latency to the processing of data, reducing user-perceived performance [32]. For a network-based system that supports cache constraints, this can be offset by the benefits of shared caching at intermediaries. Placing shared caches at the boundaries of an organizational domain can result in significant performance benefits [136]. Such layers also allow security policies to be enforced on data crossing the organizational boundary, as is required by firewalls [79].

The combination of layered system and uniform interface constraints induces architectural properties similar to those of the uniform pipe-and-filter style (Section 3.2.2). Although REST interaction is two-way, the large-grain data flows of hypermedia interaction can each be processed like a data-flow network, with filter components selectively applied to the data stream in order to transform the content as it passes [26]. Within REST, intermediary components can actively transform the content of messages because the messages are self-descriptive and their semantics are visible to intermediaries.
5.1.7 Code-On-Demand

The final addition to our constraint set for REST comes from the code-on-demand style of Section 3.5.3 (Figure 5-8). REST allows client functionality to be extended by downloading and executing code in the form of applets or scripts. This simplifies clients by reducing the number of features required to be pre-implemented. Allowing features to be downloaded after deployment improves system extensibility. However, it also reduces visibility, and thus is only an optional constraint within REST.




The notion of an optional constraint may seem like an oxymoron. However, it does have a purpose in the architectural design of a system that encompasses multiple organizational boundaries. It means that the architecture only gains the benefit (and suffers the disadvantages) of the optional constraints when they are known to be in effect for some realm of the overall system. For example, if all of the client software within an organization is known to support Java applets [45], then services within that organization can be constructed such that they gain the benefit of enhanced functionality via downloadable Java classes. At the same time, however, the organization's firewall may prevent the transfer of Java applets from external sources, and thus to the rest of the Web it will appear as if those clients do not support code-on-demand. An optional constraint allows us to design an architecture that supports the desired behavior in the general case, but with the understanding that it may be disabled within some contexts.
5.1.8 Style Derivation Summary

REST consists of a set of architectural constraints chosen for the properties they induce on candidate architectures. Although each of these constraints can be considered in isolation, describing them in terms of their derivation from common architectural styles makes it easier to understand the rationale behind their selection. Figure 5-9 depicts the derivation of REST's constraints graphically in terms of the network-based architectural styles examined in Chapter 3.



5.2 REST Architectural Elements

The Representational State Transfer (REST) style is an abstraction of the architectural elements within a distributed hypermedia system. REST ignores the details of component implementation and protocol syntax in order to focus on the roles of components, the constraints upon their interaction with other components, and their interpretation of significant data elements. It encompasses the fundamental constraints upon components, connectors, and data that define the basis of the Web architecture, and thus the essence of its behavior as a network-based application.
5.2.1 Data Elements

Unlike the distributed object style [31], where all data is encapsulated within and hidden by the processing components, the nature and state of an architecture's data elements is a key aspect of REST. The rationale for this design can be seen in the nature of distributed hypermedia. When a link is selected, information needs to be moved from the location where it is stored to the location where it will be used by, in most cases, a human reader. This is unlike many other distributed processing paradigms [6, 50], where it is possible, and usually more efficient, to move the "processing agent" (e.g., mobile code, stored procedure, search expression, etc.) to the data rather than move the data to the processor.

A distributed hypermedia architect has only three fundamental options: 1) render the data where it is located and send a fixed-format image to the recipient; 2) encapsulate the data with a rendering engine and send both to the recipient; or, 3) send the raw data to the recipient along with metadata that describes the data type, so that the recipient can choose their own rendering engine.

Each option has its advantages and disadvantages. Option 1, the traditional client-server style [31], allows all information about the true nature of the data to remain hidden within the sender, preventing assumptions from being made about the data structure and making client implementation easier. However, it also severely restricts the functionality of the recipient and places most of the processing load on the sender, leading to scalability problems. Option 2, the mobile object style [50], provides information hiding while enabling specialized processing of the data via its unique rendering engine, but limits the functionality of the recipient to what is anticipated within that engine and may vastly increase the amount of data transferred. Option 3 allows the sender to remain simple and scalable while minimizing the bytes transferred, but loses the advantages of information hiding and requires that both sender and recipient understand the same data types.

REST provides a hybrid of all three options by focusing on a shared understanding of data types with metadata, but limiting the scope of what is revealed to a standardized interface. REST components communicate by transferring a representation of a resource in a format matching one of an evolving set of standard data types, selected dynamically based on the capabilities or desires of the recipient and the nature of the resource. Whether the representation is in the same format as the raw source, or is derived from the source, remains hidden behind the interface. The benefits of the mobile object style are approximated by sending a representation that consists of instructions in the standard data format of an encapsulated rendering engine (e.g., Java [45]). REST therefore gains the separation of concerns of the client-server style without the server scalability problem, allows information hiding through a generic interface to enable encapsulation and evolution of services, and provides for a diverse set of functionality through downloadable feature-engines.

REST's data elements are summarized in Table 5-1.

5.2.1.1 Resources and Resource Identifiers

The key abstraction of information in REST is a resource. Any information that can be named can be a resource: a document or image, a temporal service (e.g. "today's weather in Los Angeles"), a collection of other resources, a non-virtual object (e.g. a person), and so on. In other words, any concept that might be the target of an author's hypertext reference must fit within the definition of a resource. A resource is a conceptual mapping to a set of entities, not the entity that corresponds to the mapping at any particular point in time.

More precisely, a resource R is a temporally varying membership function MR(t), which for time t maps to a set of entities, or values, which are equivalent. The values in the set may be resource representations and/or resource identifiers. A resource can map to the empty set, which allows references to be made to a concept before any realization of that concept exists -- a notion that was foreign to most hypertext systems prior to the Web [61]. Some resources are static in the sense that, when examined at any time after their creation, they always correspond to the same value set. Others have a high degree of variance in their value over time. The only thing that is required to be static for a resource is the semantics of the mapping, since the semantics is what distinguishes one resource from another.

For example, the "authors' preferred version" of an academic paper is a mapping whose value changes over time, whereas a mapping to "the paper published in the proceedings of conference X" is static. These are two distinct resources, even if they both map to the same value at some point in time. The distinction is necessary so that both resources can be identified and referenced independently. A similar example from software engineering is the separate identification of a version-controlled source code file when referring to the "latest revision", "revision number 1.2.7", or "revision included with the Orange release."

This abstract definition of a resource enables key features of the Web architecture. First, it provides generality by encompassing many sources of information without artificially distinguishing them by type or implementation. Second, it allows late binding of the reference to a representation, enabling content negotiation to take place based on characteristics of the request. Finally, it allows an author to reference the concept rather than some singular representation of that concept, thus removing the need to change all existing links whenever the representation changes (assuming the author used the right identifier).

REST uses a resource identifier to identify the particular resource involved in an interaction between components. REST connectors provide a generic interface for accessing and manipulating the value set of a resource, regardless of how the membership function is defined or the type of software that is handling the request. The naming authority that assigned the resource identifier, making it possible to reference the resource, is responsible for maintaining the semantic validity of the mapping over time (i.e., ensuring that the membership function does not change).

Traditional hypertext systems [61], which typically operate in a closed or local environment, use unique node or document identifiers that change every time the information changes, relying on link servers to maintain references separately from the content [135]. Since centralized link servers are an anathema to the immense scale and multi-organizational domain requirements of the Web, REST relies instead on the author choosing a resource identifier that best fits the nature of the concept being identified. Naturally, the quality of an identifier is often proportional to the amount of money spent to retain its validity, which leads to broken links as ephemeral (or poorly supported) information moves or disappears over time.
5.2.1.2 Representations

REST components perform actions on a resource by using a representation to capture the current or intended state of that resource and transferring that representation between components. A representation is a sequence of bytes, plus representation metadata to describe those bytes. Other commonly used but less precise names for a representation include: document, file, and HTTP message entity, instance, or variant.

A representation consists of data, metadata describing the data, and, on occasion, metadata to describe the metadata (usually for the purpose of verifying message integrity). Metadata is in the form of name-value pairs, where the name corresponds to a standard that defines the value's structure and semantics. Response messages may include both representation metadata and resource metadata: information about the resource that is not specific to the supplied representation.

Control data defines the purpose of a message between components, such as the action being requested or the meaning of a response. It is also used to parameterize requests and override the default behavior of some connecting elements. For example, cache behavior can be modified by control data included in the request or response message.

Depending on the message control data, a given representation may indicate the current state of the requested resource, the desired state for the requested resource, or the value of some other resource, such as a representation of the input data within a client's query form, or a representation of some error condition for a response. For example, remote authoring of a resource requires that the author send a representation to the server, thus establishing a value for that resource that can be retrieved by later requests. If the value set of a resource at a given time consists of multiple representations, content negotiation may be used to select the best representation for inclusion in a given message.

The data format of a representation is known as a media type [48]. A representation can be included in a message and processed by the recipient according to the control data of the message and the nature of the media type. Some media types are intended for automated processing, some are intended to be rendered for viewing by a user, and a few are capable of both. Composite media types can be used to enclose multiple representations in a single message.

The design of a media type can directly impact the user-perceived performance of a distributed hypermedia system. Any data that must be received before the recipient can begin rendering the representation adds to the latency of an interaction. A data format that places the most important rendering information up front, such that the initial information can be incrementally rendered while the rest of the information is being received, results in much better user-perceived performance than a data format that must be entirely received before rendering can begin.

For example, a Web browser that can incrementally render a large HTML document while it is being received provides significantly better user-perceived performance than one that waits until the entire document is completely received prior to rendering, even though the network performance is the same. Note that the rendering ability of a representation can also be impacted by the choice of content. If the dimensions of dynamically-sized tables and embedded objects must be determined before they can be rendered, their occurrence within the viewing area of a hypermedia page will increase its latency.
5.2.2 Connectors

REST uses various connector types, summarized in Table 5-2, to encapsulate the activities of accessing resources and transferring resource representations. The connectors present an abstract interface for component communication, enhancing simplicity by providing a clean separation of concerns and hiding the underlying implementation of resources and communication mechanisms. The generality of the interface also enables substitutability: if the users' only access to the system is via an abstract interface, the implementation can be replaced without impacting the users. Since a connector manages network communication for a component, information can be shared across multiple interactions in order to improve efficiency and responsiveness.
Table 5-2: REST ConnectorsConnectorModern Web Examplesclientlibwww, libwww-perlserverlibwww, Apache API, NSAPIcachebrowser cache, Akamai cache networkresolverbind (DNS lookup library)tunnelSOCKS, SSL after HTTP CONNECT

All REST interactions are stateless. That is, each request contains all of the information necessary for a connector to understand the request, independent of any requests that may have preceded it. This restriction accomplishes four functions: 1) it removes any need for the connectors to retain application state between requests, thus reducing consumption of physical resources and improving scalability; 2) it allows interactions to be processed in parallel without requiring that the processing mechanism understand the interaction semantics; 3) it allows an intermediary to view and understand a request in isolation, which may be necessary when services are dynamically rearranged; and, 4) it forces all of the information that might factor into the reusability of a cached response to be present in each request.

The connector interface is similar to procedural invocation, but with important differences in the passing of parameters and results. The in-parameters consist of request control data, a resource identifier indicating the target of the request, and an optional representation. The out-parameters consist of response control data, optional resource metadata, and an optional representation. From an abstract viewpoint the invocation is synchronous, but both in and out-parameters can be passed as data streams. In other words, processing can be invoked before the value of the parameters is completely known, thus avoiding the latency of batch processing large data transfers.

The primary connector types are client and server. The essential difference between the two is that a client initiates communication by making a request, whereas a server listens for connections and responds to requests in order to supply access to its services. A component may include both client and server connectors.

A third connector type, the cache connector, can be located on the interface to a client or server connector in order to save cacheable responses to current interactions so that they can be reused for later requested interactions. A cache may be used by a client to avoid repetition of network communication, or by a server to avoid repeating the process of generating a response, with both cases serving to reduce interaction latency. A cache is typically implemented within the address space of the connector that uses it.

Some cache connectors are shared, meaning that its cached responses may be used in answer to a client other than the one for which the response was originally obtained. Shared caching can be effective at reducing the impact of "flash crowds" on the load of a popular server, particularly when the caching is arranged hierarchically to cover large groups of users, such as those within a company's intranet, the customers of an Internet service provider, or Universities sharing a national network backbone. However, shared caching can also lead to errors if the cached response does not match what would have been obtained by a new request. REST attempts to balance the desire for transparency in cache behavior with the desire for efficient use of the network, rather than assuming that absolute transparency is always required.

A cache is able to determine the cacheability of a response because the interface is generic rather than specific to each resource. By default, the response to a retrieval request is cacheable and the responses to other requests are non-cacheable. If some form of user authentication is part of the request, or if the response indicates that it should not be shared, then the response is only cacheable by a non-shared cache. A component can override these defaults by including control data that marks the interaction as cacheable, non-cacheable or cacheable for only a limited time.

A resolver translates partial or complete resource identifiers into the network address information needed to establish an inter-component connection. For example, most URI include a DNS hostname as the mechanism for identifying the naming authority for the resource. In order to initiate a request, a Web browser will extract the hostname from the URI and make use of a DNS resolver to obtain the Internet Protocol address for that authority. Another example is that some identification schemes (e.g., URN [124]) require an intermediary to translate a permanent identifier to a more transient address in order to access the identified resource. Use of one or more intermediate resolvers can improve the longevity of resource references through indirection, though doing so adds to the request latency.

The final form of connector type is a tunnel, which simply relays communication across a connection boundary, such as a firewall or lower-level network gateway. The only reason it is modeled as part of REST and not abstracted away as part of the network infrastructure is that some REST components may dynamically switch from active component behavior to that of a tunnel. The primary example is an HTTP proxy that switches to a tunnel in response to a CONNECT method request [71], thus allowing its client to directly communicate with a remote server using a different protocol, such as TLS, that doesn't allow proxies. The tunnel disappears when both ends terminate their communication.
5.2.3 Components

REST components, summarized in Table 5-3, are typed by their roles in an overall application action.
Table 5-3: REST ComponentsComponentModern Web Examplesorigin serverApache httpd, Microsoft IISgatewaySquid, CGI, Reverse ProxyproxyCERN Proxy, Netscape Proxy, Gauntletuser agentNetscape Navigator, Lynx, MOMspider

A user agent uses a client connector to initiate a request and becomes the ultimate recipient of the response. The most common example is a Web browser, which provides access to information services and renders service responses according to the application needs.

An origin server uses a server connector to govern the namespace for a requested resource. It is the definitive source for representations of its resources and must be the ultimate recipient of any request that intends to modify the value of its resources. Each origin server provides a generic interface to its services as a resource hierarchy. The resource implementation details are hidden behind the interface.

Intermediary components act as both a client and a server in order to forward, with possible translation, requests and responses. A proxy component is an intermediary selected by a client to provide interface encapsulation of other services, data translation, performance enhancement, or security protection. A gateway (a.k.a., reverse proxy) component is an intermediary imposed by the network or origin server to provide an interface encapsulation of other services, for data translation, performance enhancement, or security enforcement. Note that the difference between a proxy and a gateway is that a client determines when it will use a proxy.
5.3 REST Architectural Views

Now that we have an understanding of the REST architectural elements in isolation, we can use architectural views [105] to describe how the elements work together to form an architecture. Three types of view--process, connector, and data--are useful for illuminating the design principles of REST.
5.3.1 Process View

A process view of an architecture is primarily effective at eliciting the interaction relationships among components by revealing the path of data as it flows through the system. Unfortunately, the interaction of a real system usually involves an extensive number of components, resulting in an overall view that is obscured by the details. Figure 5-10 provides a sample of the process view from a REST-based architecture at a particular instance during the processing of three parallel requests.




REST's client-server separation of concerns simplifies component implementation, reduces the complexity of connector semantics, improves the effectiveness of performance tuning, and increases the scalability of pure server components. Layered system constraints allow intermediaries--proxies, gateways, and firewalls--to be introduced at various points in the communication without changing the interfaces between components, thus allowing them to assist in communication translation or improve performance via large-scale, shared caching. REST enables intermediate processing by constraining messages to be self-descriptive: interaction is stateless between requests, standard methods and media types are used to indicate semantics and exchange information, and responses explicitly indicate cacheability.

Since the components are connected dynamically, their arrangement and function for a particular application action has characteristics similar to a pipe-and-filter style. Although REST components communicate via bidirectional streams, the processing of each direction is independent and therefore susceptible to stream transducers (filters). The generic connector interface allows components to be placed on the stream based on the properties of each request or response.

Services may be implemented using a complex hierarchy of intermediaries and multiple distributed origin servers. The stateless nature of REST allows each interaction to be independent of the others, removing the need for an awareness of the overall component topology, an impossible task for an Internet-scale architecture, and allowing components to act as either destinations or intermediaries, determined dynamically by the target of each request. Connectors need only be aware of each other's existence during the scope of their communication, though they may cache the existence and capabilities of other components for performance reasons.
5.3.2 Connector View

A connector view of an architecture concentrates on the mechanics of the communication between components. For a REST-based architecture, we are particularly interested in the constraints that define the generic resource interface.

Client connectors examine the resource identifier in order to select an appropriate communication mechanism for each request. For example, a client may be configured to connect to a specific proxy component, perhaps one acting as an annotation filter, when the identifier indicates that it is a local resource. Likewise, a client can be configured to reject requests for some subset of identifiers.

REST does not restrict communication to a particular protocol, but it does constrain the interface between components, and hence the scope of interaction and implementation assumptions that might otherwise be made between components. For example, the Web's primary transfer protocol is HTTP, but the architecture also includes seamless access to resources that originate on pre-existing network servers, including FTP [107], Gopher [7], and WAIS [36]. Interaction with those services is restricted to the semantics of a REST connector. This constraint sacrifices some of the advantages of other architectures, such as the stateful interaction of a relevance feedback protocol like WAIS, in order to retain the advantages of a single, generic interface for connector semantics. In return, the generic interface makes it possible to access a multitude of services through a single proxy. If an application needs the additional capabilities of another architecture, it can implement and invoke those capabilities as a separate system running in parallel, similar to how the Web architecture interfaces with "telnet" and "mailto" resources.
5.3.3 Data View

A data view of an architecture reveals the application state as information flows through the components. Since REST is specifically targeted at distributed information systems, it views an application as a cohesive structure of information and control alternatives through which a user can perform a desired task. For example, looking-up a word in an on-line dictionary is one application, as is touring through a virtual museum, or reviewing a set of class notes to study for an exam. Each application defines goals for the underlying system, against which the system's performance can be measured.

Component interactions occur in the form of dynamically sized messages. Small or medium-grain messages are used for control semantics, but the bulk of application work is accomplished via large-grain messages containing a complete resource representation. The most frequent form of request semantics is that of retrieving a representation of a resource (e.g., the "GET" method in HTTP), which can often be cached for later reuse.

REST concentrates all of the control state into the representations received in response to interactions. The goal is to improve server scalability by eliminating any need for the server to maintain an awareness of the client state beyond the current request. An application's state is therefore defined by its pending requests, the topology of connected components (some of which may be filtering buffered data), the active requests on those connectors, the data flow of representations in response to those requests, and the processing of those representations as they are received by the user agent.

An application reaches a steady-state whenever it has no outstanding requests; i.e., it has no pending requests and all of the responses to its current set of requests have been completely received or received to the point where they can be treated as a representation data stream. For a browser application, this state corresponds to a "web page," including the primary representation and ancillary representations, such as in-line images, embedded applets, and style sheets. The significance of application steady-states is seen in their impact on both user-perceived performance and the burstiness of network request traffic.

The user-perceived performance of a browser application is determined by the latency between steady-states: the period of time between the selection of a hypermedia link on one web page and the point when usable information has been rendered for the next web page. The optimization of browser performance is therefore centered around reducing this communication latency.

Since REST-based architectures communicate primarily through the transfer of representations of resources, latency can be impacted by both the design of the communication protocols and the design of the representation data formats. The ability to incrementally render the response data as it is received is determined by the design of the media type and the availability of layout information (visual dimensions of in-line objects) within each representation.

An interesting observation is that the most efficient network request is one that doesn't use the network. In other words, the ability to reuse a cached response results in a considerable improvement in application performance. Although use of a cache adds some latency to each individual request due to lookup overhead, the average request latency is significantly reduced when even a small percentage of requests result in usable cache hits.

The next control state of an application resides in the representation of the first requested resource, so obtaining that first representation is a priority. REST interaction is therefore improved by protocols that "respond first and think later." In other words, a protocol that requires multiple interactions per user action, in order to do things like negotiate feature capabilities prior to sending a content response, will be perceptively slower than a protocol that sends whatever is most likely to be optimal first and then provides a list of alternatives for the client to retrieve if the first response is unsatisfactory.

The application state is controlled and stored by the user agent and can be composed of representations from multiple servers. In addition to freeing the server from the scalability problems of storing state, this allows the user to directly manipulate the state (e.g., a Web browser's history), anticipate changes to that state (e.g., link maps and prefetching of representations), and jump from one application to another (e.g., bookmarks and URI-entry dialogs).

The model application is therefore an engine that moves from one state to the next by examining and choosing from among the alternative state transitions in the current set of representations. Not surprisingly, this exactly matches the user interface of a hypermedia browser. However, the style does not assume that all applications are browsers. In fact, the application details are hidden from the server by the generic connector interface, and thus a user agent could equally be an automated robot performing information retrieval for an indexing service, a personal agent looking for data that matches certain criteria, or a maintenance spider busy patrolling the information for broken references or modified content [39].
5.4 Related Work

Bass, et al. [9] devote a chapter on architecture for the World Wide Web, but their description only encompasses the implementation architecture within the CERN/W3C developed libwww (client and server libraries) and Jigsaw software. Although those implementations reflect many of the design constraints of REST, having been developed by people familiar with the Web's architectural design and rationale, the real WWW architecture is independent of any single implementation. The modern Web is defined by its standard interfaces and protocols, not how those interfaces and protocols are implemented in a given piece of software.

The REST style draws from many preexisting distributed process paradigms [6, 50], communication protocols, and software fields. REST component interactions are structured in a layered client-server style, but the added constraints of the generic resource interface create the opportunity for substitutability and inspection by intermediaries. Requests and responses have the appearance of a remote invocation style, but REST messages are targeted at a conceptual resource rather than an implementation identifier.

Several attempts have been made to model the Web architecture as a form of distributed file system (e.g., WebNFS) or as a distributed object system [83]. However, they exclude various Web resource types or implementation strategies as being "not interesting," when in fact their presence invalidates the assumptions that underlie such models. REST works well because it does not limit the implementation of resources to certain predefined models, allowing each application to choose an implementation that best matches its own needs and enabling the replacement of implementations without impacting the user.

The interaction method of sending representations of resources to consuming components has some parallels with event-based integration (EBI) styles. The key difference is that EBI styles are push-based. The component containing the state (equivalent to an origin server in REST) issues an event whenever the state changes, whether or not any component is actually interested in or listening for such an event. In the REST style, consuming components usually pull representations. Although this is less efficient when viewed as a single client wishing to monitor a single resource, the scale of the Web makes an unregulated push model infeasible.

The principled use of the REST style in the Web, with its clear notion of components, connectors, and representations, relates closely to the C2 architectural style [128]. The C2 style supports the development of distributed, dynamic applications by focusing on structured use of connectors to obtain substrate independence. C2 applications rely on asynchronous notification of state changes and request messages. As with other event-based schemes, C2 is nominally push-based, though a C2 architecture could operate in REST's pull style by only emitting a notification upon receipt of a request. However, the C2 style lacks the intermediary-friendly constraints of REST, such as the generic resource interface, guaranteed stateless interactions, and intrinsic support for caching.
5.5 Summary

This chapter introduced the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems. REST provides a set of architectural constraints that, when applied as a whole, emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. I described the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, while contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles.

The next chapter presents an evaluation of the REST architecture through the experience and lessons learned from applying REST to the design, specification, and deployment of the modern Web architecture. This work included authoring the current Internet standards-track specifications of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1) and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI), and implementing the architecture through the libwww-perl client protocol library and Apache HTTP server.

Academic Honesty

I trust all students are honest and do not cheat. Those who break my trust
at any point will get an F in the course - no excuses or apologies will be
accepted.Additional penalties may also be imposed by the
department and the university. Very severe incidents of academic dishonesty can
result in suspension or expulsion from the university. 



Students with Disability

Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the
impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss his or her
specific needs. Also contact the Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494
as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented
in a timely fashion.

Programming Assignments & Peer Grading
Rubrics
HW 1HW 2HW 3HW 7
Development environment

Projects will be developed and submitted using Cloud 9 (https://c9.io/). This environment supports all the languages that are allowed in this course.
Working on your assignment

Languages

The programming languages that can be used for the assignments are:
JavaPHPC#RubyJavascriptC++ (gcc 4.8)GoPerl
Cloud 9 Workspace

Choosing a username
If you don't want the students who you're peer-grading to know your identity, please pick a C9 username different enough from your name so they can't guess who you're. If you don't care about them knowing, just ignore this paragraph.

Creating a new repository

Since you will share your workspace with other students, you will have to create a new one for each assignment, otherwise, students will be able to see the stuff you¡¯re working on for this week. That¡¯s far from being a smooth way to work so, in order to reduce the overhead, you can just clone https://github.com/mgiorgio/inf212w15.git and you will get the right structure to start working right away on your weekly homework. You can clone the repository directly from Cloud 9 (Create Workspace --> Clone repository). The repository you will create must be public (non private). You can refer to https://docs.c9.io/creating_new_workspace.html for further details.

Choosing a repository name
In Cloud 9, your workspace can be accessed in read-only mode by anyone having your workspace's URL. In order to cope with that situation, please just put some random characters at the end of the workspace name. For example, if your username is abc and you are working on the HW3, you can choose something like hw3-18785 so that nobody can see your stuff unless they receive your URL. Your 
URL will look like http://ide.c9.io/abc/hw3-18785.


Protecting your workspace

In order to prevent anyone else from looking at the stuff you¡¯re working on, you must change the default sharing options. In order to do so, go to ¡°Share¡± at the top-right corner and uncheck the ¡°Public¡± option.

File organization

Your submission files must be organized as follows:
Workspace name (+ random string)
	Readings
			~200-word summary plain text file.
		Project
			stop_words.txtsrc
					Source code file.pride-and-prejudice.txtREADME.txt (optional)
				
		

Before submitting your assignment

Programs must be submitted ready to be executed. If something needs to be changed on the code to run your program or it doesn¡¯t compile, it won¡¯t be possible to evaluate your homework and you will receive zero points.
If it¡¯s expected that special parameters needs to be passed to execute the program, a README.txt file must be created in the source code¡¯s folder explaining the program must be run.

Submission

Sharing your stuff

Make your workspace public again

Now that your workspace needs to be seen by your peer-graders, you need to make it public again. In order to do so, go to the ¡°Share¡± option at the top-right corner and check the ¡°Public¡± checkbox.

Submitting your stuff (a.k.a. how does the TA know that you did your assignment?)

For each assignment, a text file must be uploaded to EEE containing:
A link to your workspace. That link will be passed to your peer-graders and the TA.The language you used.
You have time to upload this file until Saturday night. Keep in mind that if you solved the weekly assignment but did not upload this file, your work will not be considered.

Peer Grading

At the beginning of the quarter, each student must choose at least three languages to do peer grading on other students¡¯ projects. For example, if one student chooses Java, PHP and Ruby, the student will (very likely) receive programs written in those languages to be graded. This is not guaranteed, but we will do our best to assign programs written in languages that the grader feels comfortable with.
For each assignment, students will peer-grade three programs. The score and comments must be uploaded to EEE.
Part of your score will come from your job as a peer-grader. Keep in mind that the score you assign to other students is as important as the feedback you give them.

Permission to execute stuff in C9
By default, you will not have permissions to execute files in a workspace that is not yours. Consequently, in order to execute other students' code, you will request writing permissions. There is going to be an option in C9 to do so when you enter the URL that they shared.

Rubric

You will receive a rubric each week that you must use for the peer-grading. It is going to be as detailed as possible to minimize the deviation from different graders.

Summary

To sum this up, each week you will need to:
Clone the repository listed above.Create a file in C9 with the summary for the assigned reading.Solve the programming assignment in C9.Upload a text file to EEE with the link to your C9¡¯s workspace and the language you used.
After receiving the assignments that you will peer-grade:
Evaluate them.Upload a text file to EEE with a score and comments for each assignment you are peer-grading.

        S. Dumais, E. Cutell, J. Cadiz, G. Jancke, R. Sarin, and D. Robbins,
        SIGIR, 2003

        Commentary: "This paper addresses an increasingly important problem
        - how to search and manage personal collections of electronic
        information. ... it addresses an important user-centered problem.
        ...this paper presents a practical user interface to make the system
        useful. ..., the paper includes large scale, user-oriented testing that
        demonstrates the efficacy of the system. ..., the evaluation uses both
        quantitative and qualitative data to make its case. I think this paper
        is destined to be a classic because it may eventually define how people
        manage their files for a decade. Moreover, it is well-written and can
        serve as a good model for developers doing system design and
        evaluation, and for students learning about IR systems and
        evaluation."

        Commentary: "This paper provides a brief but well informed and
        technically accurate overview of the state of the art in text
        retrieval, at least up to 1997. It introduces the ideas of terms and
        matching, term weighting strategies, relevance weighting, a little on
        data structures and the evidence for their effectiveness. In my view it
        does an exemplary job of introducing the terminology of IR and the main
        issues in text retrieval for a numerate and technically well informed
        audience. It also has a very well chosen list of references."

        Abstract: "The pages and hyperlinks of the World-Wide Web may be
        viewed as nodes and edges in a directed graph. This graph has about a
        billion nodes today, several billion links, and appears to grow
        exponentially with time. There are many reasons -- mathematical,
        sociological, and commercial -- for studying the evolution of this graph.
        We first review a set of algorithms that operate on the Web graph,
        addressing problems from Web search, automatic community discovery, and
        classification. We then recall a number of measurements and properties
        of the Web graph. Noting that traditional random graph models do not
        explain these observations, we propose a new family of random graph
        models."

        Brin and L. Page (this link is to the long version, the short version
        was publishied in WWW1998)(*) 

        Commentary: "This paper (and the work it reports) has had more
        impact on everyday life than any other in the IR area. A major
        contribution of the paper is the recognition that some relevant search
        results are greatly more valued by searchers than others. By reflecting
        this in their evaluation procedures, Brin and Page were able to see the
        true value of web-specific methods like anchor text. The paper presents
        a highly efficient, scalable implementation of a ranking method which
        now delivers very high quality results to a billion people over
        billions of pages at about 6,000 queries per second. It also hints at
        the technology which Google users now take for granted: spam rejection,
        high speed query-based summaries, source clustering, and
        context(location)-sensitive search. IR and bibliometrics researchers
        had done it all (relevance, proximity, link analysis, efficiency,
        scalability, summarization, evaluation) before 1998 but this paper
        showed how to make it work on the web. For any non-IR engineer
        attempting to build a web-based retrieval system from scratch, this
        must be the first port of call."

        Commentary: " IR, as a field, hasn't directly considered the issue
        of semantic knowledge representation. The above paper is one of the few
        that does in the following way. LSI is latent semantic analysis (LSA)
        applied to document retrieval. LSA is actually a variant of a growing
        ensemble of cognitively-motivated models referred to by the term
        "semantic space". LSA has an encouraging track record of compatibility
        with human information processing across a variety of information
        processing tasks. LSA seems to capture the meaning of words in a way
        which accords with the representations we carry around in our heads.
        Finally, the above paper is often cited and interest in LSI seems to
        have increased markedly in recent years. The above paper has also made
        an impact outside our field. For example, recent work on latent
        semantic kernels (machine learning) draws heavily on LSI. "

Academic Honesty

I trust all students are honest and do not cheat. Those who break my trust
at any point will get an F in the course - no excuses or apologies will be
accepted.Additional penalties may also be imposed by the
department and the university. Very severe incidents of academic dishonesty can
result in suspension or expulsion from the university. 

So don't risk it! If, for some reason, you can't do the homework on time or
can't study for the Quiz, you're better off skipping it than cheating it. Do
the math!

SourcererCC: Scaling Type-3 Clone Detection to Large Software Repositories
				Team @UC Irvine: Hitesh Sajnani, Vaibhav Saini,  Cristina Lopes  
				Team @University of Saskatchewan: Jeff Svejlanko, Chanchal Roy
			
		
		Project Description
				
Given the availability of large-scale source-code repositories,
there have been a large number of applications for clone detection. 
Unfortunately, despite a decade of active
research, there is a marked lack in clone detectors that scale
to large software repositories. In particular for detecting near-miss clones
where significant editing activities may take place in the
cloned code.
We present SourcererCC, a token-based clone detector
that targets the first three clone types, and exploits an index
to achieve scalability to large inter-project repositories
using a standard workstation. SourcererCC uses an optimized
inverted-index to quickly query the potential clones
of a given code block. Filtering heuristics based on token ordering
are used to significantly reduce the size of the index,
the number of code-block comparisons needed to detect the
clones, as well as the number of required token-comparisons
needed to judge a potential clone. 
We evaluate the scalability, execution time, recall and precision
of SourcererCC, and compare it to four publicly available
and state-of-the-art tools. To measure recall, we use
two recent benchmarks, (1) an exhaustive benchmark of real
clones, BigCloneBench, and (2) a Mutation/Injection-based
framework of thousands of fine-grained artificial clones. We
find SourcererCC has both high recall and precision, and is
able to scale to a large inter-project repository (250MLOC)
using a standard workstation.



				

		
Tool Download and Usage
In order to run the tool please follow the steps below:

A. Generating the input file of the project for which you want to detect clones
Click here to download input generator for the code clone detector (ast.zip).Unzip ast.zip and import the project ast in your eclipse workspace.Run it as an "Eclipse Application". This should open another eclipse instance where you will import the projects for which you want to generate the input file.After importing the project in the workspace of the new eclipse instance, click on the "Sample Menu" in the top menu bar and then click on the "Sample command" to run. This should generate the output (desired input file) in the path specified by variable "outputdirPath".Please note that you will have to change the location of output directory on line 61 of SampleHandler.java.this.outputdirPath = "/Users/vaibhavsaini/Documents/codetime/repo/ast/output/"; to your desired output directory.The generated input file name will be of the format: <ProjectName>-clone-INPUT.txt. For example, if your project name is jython, then the generated input file name should be jython-clone-INPUT.txt

Precision data as reported in the paper

We randomly selected 390 of  clone pairs detected by SourcererCC for
manual inspection. This is a statistically significant sample
with a 95% confidence level and a +/- 5% confidence interval.
We split the validation efforts across three clone experts.
This prevents any one judge's personal subjectivity from influencing the entire measurement. 
The judges found 355 to be true positives, and 35 to be false positives, for a precision
of 91%.

Effectiveness of Filtering Heuristics (Figure 1 in paper)
The effectiveness of the filtering heuristics to eliminate candidate comparisons
is demonstrated on 35 open source Apache Java projects. 
These projects are of varied size and span across various
domains including search and database systems, server systems,
distributed systems, machine learning and natural language processing
libraries, network systems, etc. Most of these subject systems are
highly popular in their respective domain. Such subject systems
exhibiting variety in size and domain help counter a potential bias
of our study towards any specific kind of software system

The details of the projects including project name, size and the
number of methods is reported in Table II below. Column 3 ( # Methods)
shows total number of methods (total), number of methods after
removing methods with size < 25 tokens (>25 tokens), and methods
that are not exact duplicates (unique). Column 5 (Time Taken),
Column 6 (# Candidates) and Column 7 (Terms Compared) show
time taken to detect clones, number of candidates compared and total number of tokens compared
for:  
(i) Naive - No filtering heuristics; 
(ii) Prefix - Sub-block filtering heuristic; and  
(iii) Pos - Both Sub-block and Token Position filtering heuristics together  

The tabulated data is also charted below.
The horizontal axis shows the 35 subject systems sorted by the number of methods they contain 
(smallest on the left) . The vertical axis shows the performance metric value. The black circles,
the red triangles, and the green plus marks show the performance metric values of when no filtering
 is applied, only sub-block filtering is applied, and sub-block and token position filtering applied respectively.

Academic Honesty

I trust all students are honest and do not cheat. Those who break my trust
at any point will get an F in the course - no excuses or apologies will be
accepted.Additional penalties may also be imposed by the
department and the university. Very severe incidents of academic dishonesty can
result in suspension or expulsion from the university. 



Students with Disability

Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the
impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss his or her
specific needs. Also contact the Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494
as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented
in a timely fashion.

		Classifying Yelp reviews into relevant categories
					Yelp users give ratings and write reviews about businesses and services on Yelp. These reviews and ratings help other Yelp users to evaluate a business or a service and make a choice. While ratings are useful to convey the overall experience, they do not convey the context which led a reviewer to that experience. 
					For example, consider a yelp review about a restaurant which has 4 stars: 
					"They have the best happy hours, the food is good, and service is even better. When it is winter we become regulars".  

					If we look at only the rating, it is difficult to guess why the user rated the restaurant as 4 stars. However, after reading the review, it is not difficult to identify that the review talks about good "food", "service" and "deals/discounts" (happy hours).  
					
					A quick inspection of few hundred reviews helped us to decide important categories that are frequent in the reviews. We found 5 categories which include ¡°Food¡±, ¡°Service¡±, ¡°Ambience¡±, ¡°Deals/Discounts¡±, and ¡°Worthiness¡±. "Food" and "Service" categories are easy to interpret. "Ambience" category relates to the d¨¦cor, and look and feel of the place. "Deals and Discounts" category correspond to offers during happy hours, or specials run by the venue. ¡°Worthiness¡± category can be summarized as value for money. Users often express the sentiment whether the overall experience was worth the money. It is important to note that "Worthiness" category is different from the ¡°Price¡± attribute already provided by Yelp. "Price" captures whether the venue is ¡°inexpensive¡±, ¡°expensive¡± or ¡°very expensive¡±.  
					
					This high level categorization of reviews into relevant categories can help user to understand why the reviewer rated the restaurant as ¡°high¡± or ¡°low¡±. This information can help other yelpers to make a personalized choice, especially when one does not have much time to spend on reading the reviews. Moreover, such categorization can also be used to rank restaurants according to these categories.
					
					We formulted the task of classifying a review into relevant categories as a learning problem. However, since a review is inexclusively associated with multiple categories at the same time, it is not a simple binary classification or a multi-class classification. It is rather a multi-label classification problem. 

					Here is a short video describing how (and why?) Yelp can build some cool features using this categorization:   
					
					
					
					
					
		

		Corpus 
		The Yelp dataset released for the academic challenge contains information for 11,537 businesses. This dataset has 8,282 check-in sets, 43,873 users, 229,907 reviews for these businesses. For our study, since we are only interested in the restaurant data, we have considered out only those business that are categorized as food or restaurants. This reduced the number of business to around 5,000.  
		We selected all the reviews for these restaurants that had atleast one useful vote. From this pool of useful reviews, we randomly chose 10,000 reviews. A labeling codebook describing what categories to include was developed through an initial open coding of a random sample of 400 reviews. The codebook was validated and re?ned based on a second random sample of 200 reviews. This exercise helped us to fix 5 categories which include food, ambience, service, deals, and worthiness. Once we identified these 5 categories, the 10,000 reviews were divided into 5 bins with repitition in each bin. 6 Graduate student researchers from our group then read and annotated each of these reviews in the identified categories. It took us approx. 225 man hours to annotate all the reviews. We identified the conflicts in the annotation of reviews among different annotators. We removed all the reviews from the analysis where there were discrepancies among the annotators. This left us with 9019 reviews. We split these annotated reviews into 80% train and 20% test data. 

		The review annotation process was very challenging and time consuming. We believe that it is one of the major contributions of this work. We plan to release the annotated data for researchers to extend the work. 
		
		

	
	Feature Extraction and Normalization
	We extracted two types of features: (i) star ratings and (ii) textual features consisting of unigrams, bigrams and trigrams. 
	For star ratings we created three binary features representing rating 1-2 stars, 3 stars, and 4-5 stars respectively. 
	For extracting textual features, we ?rst normalized the review text by converting it to lower¨Ccase and removing the special characters. We did not remove the stop words as they play important role to understand user sentiments.
	The cleaned text is then tokenized to collect unigrams (individual words) and calculate their frequencies across the entire corpus. 
	This results in 54,121 unique unigrams. We condense this feature set by only considering unigrams with a frequency greater than 300, which results in 375 unigram features. 
	Similarly we extract 208 bigrams and 120 trigrams.
	
	The arff files for the the features extracted for Train and Test data can be downloaded from here:  Train.arff and  Test.arff
	 
	Here is a short video describing the corpus and the feature engineering   
	
	

		Classification
		
		In this section, we will describe the various approaches we took to build a classifier. We will reason about our choices based on the advantage and disadvantage of each approach. 
		You can also have a look at the video presentation, to get a quick overall idea  
		
		

		The problem of classifying a review into multiple categories is a not a simple binary classification problem. Since a reviewer can talk about various things in his or her review, each review can be classified into multiple categories.  
		
		One of the most popular and perhaps the simplest way to deal with multiple categories is to create a binary classifier for each category. So in our case, we create 5 binary classifiers for food, service, ambience, deals, and worthiness category. In order to do this, we need to transform the dataset into 5 different datasets where each dataset has information only about one category.  
		
		To understand consider a scaled down version of our dataset which has only 4 categories (food, ambience, service, and deals)
		As shown in Figure 1., we create four different dataset from this original dataset such that each dataset is only associated with a specific category. For example, The new dataset created for "food" category will have only one label. The label will be '1' for all the datapoints which had '1' for "food" in the original dataset. Similarly the dataset created for "service" will have label as '1' for all the datapoints that had service as '1' in the original dataset. This is done for all the categories present in the dataset. 
		
		Given a new review, binary classifier for each category predicts if the review belongs to a category. The final prediction is the union of all the binary predictors.  
	 
		 Figure 1. 
		 
		
	
		Once the dataset is transformed in 4 different datasets, any binary classifier like nearest neighbour, SVM, decision trees, etc. can be used with this approach.  Although this approach is pretty simple and treats each category independently. However, as a consequence, it ignores correlation among categories. This assumption may not hold true, especially if the categories share some aspects with each other. For example, in our case, mostly when people get deals, they feel the restaurant is worthy to visit. This means that "deals" and "worthiness" categories are correlated. Similarly we saw correlation between "service" and "ambience" category. Sometimes the correlation may be high, and sometimes it may be very low. However, in our case, we thought it was worth accounting for.  
		
		In order to account for correlation among categories, we considered each different subset of L as a single category. Here L is the set of all the categories, a.k.a targets. So L = {Food, Service, Ambience, Deals}. For example, as shown in Figure 2, we transform the target for the Review 1, {Food, Deals} as a single target with value "1001". Similary for Review 2, {Ambience, Deals}, is tranformed into "0011". Here the pattern is formed by creating a vector which has fixed indices for each category. We then learn a multi-class classifier h : X --> P(L), where X is the review, P(L) is the powerset of L, containing all possible category subsets. This approach takes into account correlations between categories, but also suffers from the large number of category subsets. E.g., if we have 5 categories, this approach will generate 25 possible targets to predict; most of which will have only few datapoints to learn. This approach might work well if there is a large training dataset which covers all (at least most of) the possible targets to predict.		
		 
		  
		Figure 2. 
		
		
		We wanted to get best of both worlds i.e., consider correlation among categories and at the same time not get hit by the large number of subsets generated by the previous approach. Hence, we decided to use ensemble of classifiers where each classifier is trained using a different small subset (k) of categories. 
		For example, let's say there are 4 categories {Food, Service, Ambience, Deals}. We choose subset size = 2. Hence, we build a total of 4C2 = 6 classifiers for the following  combination of categories: {(Food,Service), (Food,Ambience), (Food, Deals), (Service, Ambience), (Service, Deals), (Ambience, Deals)}. See first part of Figure 3. 
		For prediction, as shown in second part of Figure 3, we consider prediction of all the six classifiers and then take a majority vote.  

		This approach considers correlations among categories and at the same time does not generate very large number of targets by considering only a small subset of categories for each classifier.  
		
		 
		 
		Figure 3. 
		
		
	
		
		Experiments
		
		Evaluation metrics
		We use Precision and Recall to measure the performance of a classifier. 
		To understand, what precision and recall means in our context,
		consider (x,Y) to be a datapoint where x is the review text and Y is the set of true categories. Y ? L, where L = {Food, Service, Ambience, Deals, Worthiness}. 
		Let h be a classifier 
		Let Z = h(x) be the set of categories predicted by h for the datapoint(x, Y). Then, 
		Precision = |Y ¡É Z|/|Z|  (Out of the categories predicted, how many of the them are true categories) 
		Recall = |Y ¡É Z|/|Y| (Out of the total true categories, how many of them were predicted)

		Results 
		
		We experimented with all the three approaches discussed above. We used Precision and Recall as our evaluation metrics. For each review, dThe comprehensive set of experiment configurations (different approaches, different classifiers, different feature sets, paramter settings) can be found in this result sheet.   
		
		In the first approach of using L binary classifiers, where L is the total number of categories, we used Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machines (SMO implementation), decision trees, and Neural Networks. In the figure below we report results for Naive Bayes and K-NN for this approach as only they were competitive. 
		
		In the second approach, where we consider label correlations and predict the powerset of labels. Decision trees performed the best in this category. We also experimented with ensemble of classifiers approach using decision trees that gave us the best results overall.  
		
		
		
		
			
		
	
		 Conclusion 
		Yelp	 reviews	 and	 ratings	 are	 important	 source	 of	 information	 to	 make	 informed
decisions	about	a	venue.	We	conjecture	 that	 further	classification	of	yelp	reviews	into
relevant	categories	can	help	users	to	make	an	informed	decision	based	on	their	personal
preferences	for	categories.	Moreover,	this	aspect	is	especially	useful	when	users	do	not
have	 time	 to	 read	 many	 reviews	 to	 infer	 the	 popularity	 of	 venues	 across	 these

In	 this	 paper,	 we	 demonstrated	 how	 reviews	 for	 restaurants	 can	 be	 automatically
classified	 into	 five	 relevant	 categories	 with	 precision	 and	 recall	 of	 0.72 and	 0.71
respectively.	 We	 found	that	 an ensemble	 of	 two	 multi-label	 classification	 technique
(Binary	 Relevance	 and	 Label	 Powerset)	 performed	 better	 than	 the	 techniques
individually.	Moreover,	 there	is	 no	 significant	 difference	in	 performance	when	 using	a

Concentration in Informatics - Track in Interactive and Collaborative 
Technology (INF-ICT), (M.S. and Ph.D.)

The ICT track of the Informatics concentration focuses on studying 
and enhancing the relationship between the design and use of interactive
 systems and their applications in real-world settings.
CURRENT DEGREE REQUIREMENTS
UCI enjoys an international reputation for its research on the human 
and social dimensions of computer system design and use. There are two 
principal strands to this work. The first concerns the interaction 
between people and computers, including novel forms of interactive 
experience beyond traditional desktop computing. The second concerns the
 role that computer systems can play in collaborative work between 
individuals, groups, and organizations.
Examples of topics that ICT researchers investigate include: adoption
 and diffusion of collaborative technologies; software architectures for
 user-adaptive systems; universal access to interactive systems; design 
principles for information visualization; and new patterns of 
computer-mediated work such as virtual teams.
The approach used places equal emphasis on three areas of 
investigation--empirical, theoretical, and technical. The empirical work
 involves studying technology in use, using both laboratory techniques 
and fieldwork investigations of real-world settings. The theoretical 
research employs and develops analytic understanding of the 
relationships among technology, people, organizations, and social 
settings. Finally, in the technical work, ICT researchers develop new 
models and technologies for interaction with and collaboration through 
technology. Students in the ICT track gain a thorough grounding in all 
three areas.
The cornerstone of this approach is to study real use of technology, 
as it occurs in real-world settings. ICT researchers believe that the 
success or failure of technology depends on how people can fit that 
technology into real practice, balancing technical, cognitive, social, 
and cultural dimensions. 
Using an interdisciplinary approach, ICT research aims at a deeper 
understanding of interaction with and collaboration through technology, 
and at exploiting these insights for the design of better systems.

Scaling Token-Based Code Clone Detection

			
				The Team
				Hitesh Sajnani, Vaibhav Saini, Cristina Lopes  
			
		
		Abstract
We propose a new token-based approach for large scale code  clone detection which is based on a filtering heuristic that reduces the number of token comparisons when the two code blocks are compared. We also present a MapReduce based parallel algorithm that uses the filtering heuristic and scales to thousands of projects. The filtering heuristic is generic and can also be used in conjunction with other token-based approaches. In that context, we demonstrate how it can increase the retrieval speed and decrease the memory usage of the index-based approaches.

In our experiments on 36 open source Java projects, we found that: (i) filtering reduces token comparisons by a factor of 10, and thus increasing
the speed of clone detection by a factor of 1.5; (ii) the speed-up and scale-up of the parallel approach using filtering is near-linear on a cluster of
2-32 nodes for 150-2800 projects; and (iii) filtering decreases the memory usage of index-based approach by half and the search time by a factor of 5.?				

		Replicating the Experiment
		System Requirements
		You need a machine with at least 12GB ram running ubuntu or mac-osx, with Java-1.6 or higher installed. Please note that you need system with higher ram because the experiment involves very large subject systems. However, if you are running this on smaller systems (see Tools below), there is no such constraint.
		Steps to replicate the experiment:
		
		Click here to download the distribution (dist.zip). 
		
                unzip dist.zip. Navigate to dist/ using terminal
                
                execute the command ./runexp.sh 1 
		??? Please Note: this will run the experiment 1 time. To run it n times, change the command to ./runexp.sh n
                
	You can see the generated output in the ./output folder. Files with extension .txt will have computed clones and the files with .csv extension will have the performance analysis result. 

		
Tools
In order to run the tool on any arbitrary project, please follow the steps below:

A. Generating the input file of the project for which you want to detect clones
Click here to download input generator for the code clone detector (ast.zip).Unzip ast.zip and import the project ast in your eclipse workspace.Run it as an "Eclipse Application". This should open another eclipse instance where you will import the projects for which you want to generate the input file.After importing the project in the workspace of the new eclipse instance, click on the "Sample Menu" in the top menu bar and then click on the "Sample command" to run. This should generate the output (desired input file) in the path specified by variable "outputdirPath".Please note that you will have to change the location of output directory on line 61 of SampleHandler.java.this.outputdirPath = "/Users/vaibhavsaini/Documents/codetime/repo/ast/output/"; to your desired output directory.The generated input file name will be of the format: <ProjectName>-clone-INPUT.txt. For example, if your project name is jython, then the generated input file name should be jython-clone-INPUT.txt

B. Running the clone detection tool on the generated input file
Click here to download the CloneDetector (tool.zip).Unzip tool.zip and navigate to tool/ using terminalCopy the input file generated above (<ProjectName>-clone-INPUT.txt) into input/dataset directory.Open cd.sh, and assign <ProjectName> as value to the variable  arrayname (line #5). For example, If your generated input file is jython-clone-INPUT.txt, line #5 should be arrayname=(jython)Execute the command ./cd.sh

C. Generated output
The generated output will be in the ./output folder. Files with extension .txt will have the computed clones and the files with .csv extension will have the time taken to detect clones
		Data
The table below describes all the subject systems, and the corresponding output. This data was used to calculate and report numbers in the paper. 
Column 1 has links to the source code of each subject system. Column 2 is the input file that is generated by running INPUTGEN tool on the subject systems. 
This input file is in turn used by NCCF and FCCD to compute clones. Column 4 has links to the computed clones. Since both the tools produced exactly the same output, you will see only one file per subject system. Column 4 has the final analysis results - runtime for tool, and total token comparisons done. These numbers are different for both the tools, so you will see two analysis files per project - one produced by NCCF, and another by FCCD.
