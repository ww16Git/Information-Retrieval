                  The Informatics faculty and research program at U.C. Irvine are ranked as some of the best in the world. Informatics faculty have been involved in numerous major grant-funded research efforts, including several current projects receiving significant federal funding from agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF). We maintain connections to research groups elsewhere in the University of California system, across the country, and around the world. 
                  
                  The home department for researchers interested in CSCW, HCI, Educational Technologies, Biomedical Informatics, Organizations and Technology, Ubiquitous Computing, and Software Engineering at UC Irvine is the Department of Informatics in the Donald Bren School of ICS. Additionally, researchers focused on these topics from other schools and departments across campus collaborate closely with the Dept. of Informatics and in many cases are cross-appointed with our department.
