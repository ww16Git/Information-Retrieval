Philosophy



Recent breakthroughs in sequencing technology, genomics, gene
expression profling, and compuational science have changed the face of modern
biology, transforming it into a largely information-based
science. This course introduces the state-of-the-art computational methods used
in studying modern biological systems. We study the principles of
algorithm design for biological datasets, analyze commonly used algorithms, and
apply them to solve real-life problems. The course serves as an introductory
course to the rapidly growing field of computational biology and
bioinformatics. 
Students involved in active research in biology or bioinformatics are encouraged to
bring their own research projects into the class, and develop them into 
course projects by teaming up with students from computer science.

		The Information Systems Group (ISG) at UC Irvine is part of the Department of Computer Science  within the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences.
		 
		ISG is a broad and vital group consisting of five UCI CS faculty members (Profs. Carey, Jain, Li, Mehrotra, and Venkatasubramanian), adjunct faculty member (Prof. Kalashnikov), students, visitors, project staff, and other affiliates.
		The mission of ISG is broad-ranging, as the combination of the next-generation Web, diverse forms of multimodal data, and new devices have created a world rich with heterogeneous forms of information that need to be located, accessed, queried, managed, archived, and integrated much like the more traditional (yet ever important) enterprise data of yesteryear.
		ISG's mission is to address this rapidly evolving information infrastructure by conducting research on all aspects of modern data and information systems. 
		ISG faculty interests range from theory to systems, from principles to practice, and from design and experimentation to deployment and applications.
		Application focus areas include emergency response, situational awareness, and cyber-physical systems.
		Research topics with ISG cover architectures, algorithms, and performance evaluation of a variety of next-generation information systems and techologies.
		Current topics include database systems, data analysis and data cleansing, data warehousing systems, information integration tools, multimedia information systems and search, semantic Web, adaptive middleware, experiential computing, peer-to-peer systems, mobile and pervasive computing, service-oriented architectures, search techniques, scalable data-intensive computing, and data sharing and dissemination.
		Current projects within ISG are exploring challenges in the realization of such systems stemming from information diversity and heterogeneity (e.g., multidimensional data, XML, text, multimedia data, and sensor streams) and due to emerging application needs (including privacy and security, mobility, quality of data, quality of service, and reliability and robustness in extreme situations).
		M.S./Ph.D. Studies in Information Systems at UC Irvine The faculty of the Information Systems Group (ISG) at UC Irvine is looking for a handful of excellent prospective students who are seeking an exciting, active place to study and do research on databases and information systems starting each Fall. 
		Several large projects are underway and several new ones are just beginning and will provide excellent opportunities for incoming students to "get in on the ground floor" of interesting new research initiatives.
		ISG is a part of the CS Department within the Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences at UC Irvine, an environment that offers a number of unique advantages and opportunities.  Being one of just a handful of such schools across the country, ICS offers a broad, stimulating intellectual environment for graduate studies.  ICS is comprised of three departments - Computer Science, Informatics, and Statistics - covering all traditional computer science areas as well as related areas such as software engineering, human-computer interaction and usability, collaboration technologies, and statistical machine learning and data mining and analysis.
		
		UC Irvine itself, in the words of our current chancellor, "combines the strengths of a major research university with the bounty of an incomparable Southern California location."  Thus, in addition to a stimulating research and educational environment, graduate study in ISG at UC Irvine offers attractive off-hours opportunities.  Our location in  Orange County  offers easy access to a wide variety of outdoor and indoor entertainment and sporting activities.
		
		More information about graduate study in CS at UC Irvine can be found on the CS Department's graduate studies page.  Applications for admission for a given Fall are due by January 15th of that calendar year.  More specifics about ISG, its faculty, and its projects can be found on our new ISG web site.

Donald Bren Hall




		  
The six-story Donald Bren Hall  expanded the existing Bren School campus and increased general assignment classroom space by more than 90,800 square feet. 
The design of this facility is intended to enhance interaction between faculty and students and to create a progressive learning environment. 
Designed with flexibility in mind, the building  accommodates the Bren School's  growing faculty, staff and student populations. 
The first classes in Donald Bren Hall were held Jan. 5, 2007; the Dean's office moved in on Jan. 8, 2007. 
On June 20, Donald Bren Hall was offically dedicated during a morning ceremony which was attended by Donald Bren, former Dean Debra J. Richardson, Chancellor Michael Drake and about 400 campus and community guests.
An open house followed the ceremony, allowing the on-campus and off-campus community a rare sneak peek into the school's  various research projects and their global impact on everyday lives. 
Donald Bren Hall accommodates: 
More than 125 faculty offices90 research labs, wet labs and/or offices10 classrooms (from 30-seat to 65-seat)250-seat lecture hall125-seat lecture hall2 50-seat lecture hallDean's office/administrative supportDepartmental officesBren School  staff offices/facilities
Ceremonial groundbreaking on Donald Bren Hall took place on June 9, 2004. Visitors can view the groundbreaking press release as well as photos from the groundbreaking ceremony, attended by the building's namesake, philanthropist and chairman of The Irvine Company, Donald Bren.

Welcome from Dean Stern






Welcome to the Donald Bren School of Information and
Computer Sciences (ICS) at UC Irvine. As the only computing-focused school in the University of California
system, the Bren School is a unique place for study, research and collaboration. Our three departments ¡ª Computer
Science, Informatics and Statistics ¡ª incorporate a broad range of curricular
and research interests across the informational and computational sciences.
The school offers a range of undergraduate majors
(six in all), including recently developed majors in Computer Game Science and Business Information Management. The diverse selection of majors enables
students to gain in-depth knowledge of the information and computer sciences
while developing an understanding of the broad reach of the discipline. Our goal is to give students the real-world
tools necessary to succeed in the ever-changing technology industry.
Our faculty and graduate students are leaders in their research areas which span
information and computer sciences; they obtain corporate and federal extramural
grants, they write leading textbooks in their fields, publish influential
journal articles, and participate in key conferences and workshops.? Research in the information and
computer sciences is applicable across many scholarly and scientific fields.? Indeed, applications to scientific and
policy questions in the biological/health, engineering, and social science
disciplines motivate much of our research.
I invite you to explore our website and learn more about the
Bren School. Please feel free to
contact me at icsdean@ics.uci.edu if
you have questions or comments.
Thanks,


		  Hal SternTed and Janice Smith Family Foundation Dean

        	Overview
            Welcome to the new home of the AsterixDB Big Data Management
            System (BDMS). The AsterixDB BDMS is the result of about 3.5 years
            of R&D involving researchers at UC Irvine, UC Riverside, and UC San
            Diego. The AsterixDB code base now consists of roughly 250K lines
            of Java code that has been co-developed at UC Irvine and UC
            Riverside.
            
            Initiated in 2009, the NSF-sponsored ASTERIX project has been
            developing new technologies for ingesting, storing, managing,
            indexing, querying, and analyzing vast quantities of
            semi-structured information. The project has been combining ideas
            from three distinct areas¡ªsemi-structured data, parallel databases,
            and data-intensive computing (a.k.a. today¡¯s Big Data platforms)¡ªin
            order to create a next-generation, open-source software platform
            that scales by running on large, shared-nothing commodity computing
            clusters.

            The ASTERIX effort has been targeting a wide range of
            semi-structured information, ranging from ¡°data¡± use cases¡ªwhere
            information is well-typed and highly regular¡ªto ¡°content¡± use
            cases¡ªwhere data tends to be irregular, much of each datum may be
            textual, and the ultimate schema for the various data types
            involved may be hard to anticipate up front. The ASTERIX project
            has been addressing technical issues including highly scalable data
            storage and indexing, semi-structured query processing on very
            large clusters, and merging time-tested parallel database
            techniques with modern data-intensive computing techniques to
            support performant yet declarative solutions to the problem of
            storing and analyzing semi-structured information effectively.
            
            The first fruits of this labor have been captured in the
            AsterixDB system that is now being released in preliminary or
            ¡°Beta¡± release form. We are hoping that the arrival of AsterixDB
            will mark the beginning of the ¡°BDMS era¡±, and we hope that both
            the Big Data community and the database community will find the
            AsterixDB system to be interesting and useful for a much broader
            class of problems than can be addressed with any one of today¡¯s
            current Big Data platforms and related technologies (e.g., Hadoop,
            Pig, Hive, HBase, MongoDB, and so on). One of our project mottos
            has been ¡°one size fits a bunch¡±¡ªat least that has been our
            aim.

as Dean Debra J. Richardson looks on. view more photos ?








			  Donald Bren, Dean Debra J. Richardson, Chancellor Michael Drake and about 400 campus and community guests celebrated the opening of Donald Bren Hall June 20. 
              Bren participated in a ceremonial ribbon cutting, toured the building¡¯s laboratories and saw faculty research displays. Joining Bren at the event were Chancellor Drake; his wife, Brenda;  Assemblyman Todd Spitzer; Orange County Supervisor Bill Campbell; and Irvine Mayor Beth Krom.
              Both the school and building were named in honor of Irvine Company Chairman Donald Bren, whose $20 million gift bolstered the school's efforts. 
              Bren Hall is the new home of the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, a nationally ranked program that promotes cutting-edge research and interdisciplinary learning.
              An open house  followed the dedication ceremony, allowing the on campus and off-campus community a rare sneak peak into the school's various research projects and their global impact on everyday lives.  
              To learn more about some of these innovative and collaborative projects, please view these informational videos.
            A photo gallery from the dedication can be viewed below and a video recording of the dedication ceremony and ribbon cutting is also available for viewing. 
              A collection of media articles about the event is also available.

        Invited Talks Upcoming Events Feb 12, 2016SPEAKER: Wenjun ZengHuman Centric Video Analytic
             DetailsDate and TimeFeb 12, 2016 2PMLocationDBH 3011SpeakerWenjun ZengTitleHuman Centric Video Analytic
             AbstractVideo is the biggest big data that contains an enormous amount of information. At Microsoft Research Asia, we are leveraging computer vision and deep learning to develop a cloud-based intelligence engine that can turn raw video data into insights to facilitate various applications and services. In this talk, I will introduce our recent effort on human centric video analysis and present some latest technologies we have developed including online learning based face/human tracking/identification, skeleton-based human action recognition using regularized deep LSTM networks, and real-time human action detection and forecasting in streaming video, etc. I will also shed some light on the go-to-market aspect of this intelligent cloud effort.Speaker BioWenjun (Kevin) Zeng is a Principal Research Manager overseeing the Internet Media Group and the Media Computing Group at Microsoft Research Asia, while on leave from the Univ. of Missouri (MU). He had worked for PacketVideo Corp., Sharp Labs of America, Bell Labs, and Panasonic Technology prior to joining MU in 2003. Wenjun has contributed significantly to the development of international standards (ISO MPEG, JPEG2000, and OMA).  He received his B.E., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Tsinghua Univ., the Univ. of Notre Dame, and Princeton Univ., respectively.  His current research interest includes mobile-cloud media computing, computer vision, social network/media analysis, multimedia communications, and content/network security.
              
              He is an Associate Editor-in-Chief of IEEE Multimedia Magazine, an AE of IEEE Trans. on Circuits & Systems for Video Technology (TCSVT), and was an AE of IEEE Trans. on Info. Forensics & Security and IEEE Trans. on Multimedia (TMM). He is/was on the Steering Committee of IEEE Trans. on Mobile Computing (current) and IEEE TMM (2009-2012). He served as the Steering Committee Chair of IEEE ICME in 2010 and 2011, and has served as the TPC Chair of several IEEE conferences (e.g., ChinaSIP¡¯15, WIFS¡¯13, ICME¡¯09, CCNC¡¯07). He will be a general co-Chair of ICME2018. He is currently guest editing a TCSVT Special Issue on Visual Computing in the Cloud - Mobile Computing, and was a Special Issue Guest Editor for the Proceedings of the IEEE, IEEE TMM, and ACM TOMCCAP.  He is a Fellow of the IEEE. Past Events Jan 22, 2016SPEAKER: Pat Helland (Salesforce.com)Subjective Consistency 
             DetailsDate and TimeJan 22, 2016 2PMLocationDBH 3011SpeakerPat Helland (Salesforce.com)TitleSubjective Consistency 
             AbstractGray and Reuter define consistency as: ¡°A transaction is a correct transformation of the state. The actions taken as a group do not violate any of the integrity constraints associated with the state. This requires that the transaction be a correct program.¡± Loosely translated, you should be happy with yourself. In your own opinion, you should be sane. Through the years, this most ill defined property of the ACID transaction has been conflated with isolation and interpreted through the prism of read/write updates to an apparently centralized record oriented database. This suits systems developers that need a narrow definition to feel they can accomplish something. Unfortunately, it leaves many real world problems in the dust. In this talk, we will explore the models of consistency and the facades of reality used in practical Systems.Speaker BioPat Helland has 37 years experience implementing databases, transaction systems, application platforms, replication systems, fault tolerance, and distributed systems.
             
             From 1973-1976, Pat attended UC Irvine in the ICS department, loved his ICS undergrad and grad classes, and lived non-stop at the computing facility as an operator on the PDP-10 and Xerox Sigma-7.  This was back in the day when a computer was the size of a room and the only way to program was to stay up all night accessing the timesharing system.  
             
             During the 1980s, Pat was Chief Architect of the Tandem NonStop's TMF (Transaction Monitoring Facility), the transaction processing and recovery engine behind NonStop SQL.
             
             He started working at Microsoft in 1994 and drove the design and architecture for MTS (Microsoft Transaction Server), the N-tier transactional computing environment for Windows as well DTC, the Distributed Transaction Coordinator. A few years later, Pat led the development of SQL Service Broker, a high speed exactly once transactional messaging system.
             
             From 2005 to early 2007, Pat worked at Amazon on the Product Catalog. In 2007, he returned to Microsoft working on a number of projects including adding indexing and affinitized placement of data into Cosmos, the massively parallel computation and storage engine behind Bing (Big Data). Cosmos supports exabytes of data running on hundreds of thousands of computers. He was one of the original architects for the real-time event driven transactional engine for Cosmos.
             
             Since early 2012, Pat has worked at Salesforce.com on database management, storage, and data center issues.  He was recently added to the UCI ICS Inaugural Hall of Fame.
             Dec 4th, 2015SPEAKER: Volker Mische (Couchbase)Indexing Data at Scale in Couchbase Server
             DetailsDate and TimeDec 4th, 2015 2PMLocationDBH 4011SpeakerVolker Mische (Couchbase)TitleIndexing Data at Scale in Couchbase Server
             AbstractThis talk will provide an overview of Couchbase Server with a focus on its new query and indexing capabilities. The talk will include a look under the hood at how NoSQL data is stored, scaled, indexed, and queried at scale in the Couchbase world.Speaker BioVolker Mische was the creator of GeoCouch, a geospatial extension for Apache CouchDB and Couchbase. A degree (diploma) in computer science with a minor in geography (University of Augsburg, Germany) and a one year intership at LISAsoft Pty Ltd, Australia in 2008 deepened his experience in the geospatial field. As a proponent of open source, Volker has contributed to various projects, including Apache CouchDB, MapQuery (project lead), OpenLayers, TileCache, GeoNetwork, Rockbox and WYMeditor.Nov 13th, 2015SPEAKER: Ahmed Eldawy (U. Minnesota)SpatialHadoop: A MapReduce Framework for Spatial Data
             DetailsDate and TimeNov 13th, 2015 2PMLocationDBH 4011SpeakerAhmed Eldawy (U. Minnesota)TitleSpatialHadoop: A MapReduce Framework for Spatial Data
             Abstract This talk describes SpatialHadoop, a full-fledged MapReduce framework which extends Hadoop to support spatial data processing efficiently. SpatialHadoop injects spatial data awareness inside the core of Hadoop to make it orders of magnitude more efficient than plain-vanilla Hadoop. It adapts traditional spatial indexes, such as R-tree, Quad tree and K-d tree, to HDFS and uses these indexes to support a wide range of spatial operations, including, range query, kNN, spatial join, and computational geometry operations. In addition, it provides a high level language, termed Pigeon, which makes the system easier for non-technical users. Furthermore, SpatialHadoop has an extensible and scalable visualization layer that is able to produce giga-pixel images for terabytes of data, which allows users to explore big spatial data. The open source nature of SpatialHadoop allows it to be used in a wide range of research projects and live applications, including, SHAHED, for querying and visualizing satellite data, TAREEG, a web-based extractor for OpenStreetMap data, and TAGHREED, a system for querying and analyzing Twitter data.Speaker BioAhmed Eldawy is a sixth year PhD candidate at the Computer Science and Engineering department in University of Minnesota. He is a member of the Data Management Lab under the supervision of Prof. Mohamed Mokbel. His broad area of research interest is in databases and data management. His main research topic for PhD purposes is spatial data management in distributed environments. He is the founder and creator of SpatialHadoop, one of the most widely used systems for processing spatial data using MapReduce. He will be visiting UCI to work with the AsterixDB team for one month in the Nov./Dec. 2015 timeframe.
             Nov 6th, 2015SPEAKER: Profs. Vassilis Tsotras (UC Riverside) & Sharad Mehrotra (UC Irvine)Dealing with BAD TIPPERS
             DetailsDate and TimeNov 6th, 2015 2PMLocationDBH 4011SpeakerProfs. Vassilis Tsotras (UC Riverside) & Sharad Mehrotra (UC Irvine)TitleDealing with BAD TIPPERS
             AbstractThe first full ISG Seminar of 2015-16 will be a sequence of two half-hour talks on new projects that are happening in the world of ISG.
             The first talk will describe the BAD project, where BAD is short for Big Active Data. BAD is a joint effort between UCR and UCI. First-generation Big Data management projects like AsterixDB have been passive in nature - queries, updates, and data analysis techniques have been scaled to handle very large volumes of data. In contrast, the BAD effort aims to develop techniques to continuously and reliably capture Big Data collections (arising from social, mobile, Web, and sensed data sources) and to provide timely delivery of the right information to the relevant end users. In short, BAD aims to provide a scalable foundation for moving from Big Passive Data to Big Active Data. Techniques are being developed to enable the accumulation and monitoring of petabytes of data of potential interest to millions of end users; when "interesting" new data appears, it should be delivered to end users in a time frame measured in (100's of) milliseconds. The NSF-sponsored BAD project has been underway for just one year, and it will eventually lead to a series of BAD results, BAD papers, and BAD open source software.
             The second talk will describe a brand new UCI project, sponsored by DARPA, called TIPPERS. To learn more about TIPPERS, you'll just have to come to the talk!Speaker BioVassilis Tsotras is a Professor of Computer Science at UC Riverside and co-PI of the AsterixDB project and now the BAD project, both of which span UCR and UCI. He is also the director of the newly formed Data Science Center at UCR. Sharad Mehrotra is a Professor of Computer Science at UC Irvine and co-PI of the TIPPERS project. He is also the Vice Chair for Graduate Studies here at UCI.Oct 9, 2015SPEAKER: David Lomet (Microsoft Research)Multi-Version Range Concurrency Control in Deuteronomy
             DetailsDate and TimeOct 9, 2015 2PMLocationDBH 4011SpeakerDavid Lomet (Microsoft Research)TitleMulti-Version Range Concurrency Control in Deuteronomy
             AbstractThe Deuteronomy transactional key value store executes millions of serializable transactions/second by exploiting multi-version timestamp order concurrency control.  However, it has not supported range operations, only individual record operations (e.g., create, read, update, delete).  In this paper, we enhance our multi-version timestamp order technique to handle range concurrency and prevent phantoms. Importantly, we maintain high performance while respecting the clean separation of duties required by Deuteronomy, where a transaction component performs purely logical concurrency control (including range support), while a data component performs data storage and management duties. Our range technique continues to manage concurrency information in a latch-free manner.  With our range enhancement, Deuteronomy can reach scan speeds of nearly 250 million records/s (more than 27 GB/s) on modern hardware, while providing serializable isolation complete with phantom prevention.Speaker BioDavid Lomet founded and  manages the Database Group at Microsoft Research Redmond. Earlier, he worked at DEC, IBM, and as professor at Wang  Institute. He has a PhD from University of Pennsylvania.  David has worked in architecture, languages, and distributed systems. His primary focus is database systems. He is an inventor of transactions while on sabbatical at University of Newcastle-on- Tyne in 1975.  He has  authored 100+ papers, including two SIGMOD best papers, and he holds over 50 patents. He and his group have made multiple contributions to Microsoft products. His recent Bw-tree is used  in SQL Server's Hekaton main-memory dbms (http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/news/features/hekaton-122012.aspx).  David has been ICDE PC co-chair and conference co-chair, TC on Data Engineering chair, ICDE Steering Committee member, and member of the Computer Society Board of Governors. David was awarded IEEE Meritorious Service and SIGMOD Contributions Awards  for serving as editor in chief  of the  IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin for 20+ years (http://tab.computer.org/tcde/bull_about.html). He has served as VLDB PC co-chair, and on the VLDB Board, and been an editor of ACM TODS and VLDB Journal. He is a Fellow of the IEEE (and Golden  Core Member), ACM, and AAAS.Sep 8, 2015SPEAKER: Themis Palpanas (Paris Descartes University)Data Series Management: The Road to Big Sequence Analytics
             DetailsDate and TimeSep 8, 2015 NoonLocationDBH 3011SpeakerThemis Palpanas (Paris Descartes University)TitleData Series Management: The Road to Big Sequence Analytics
             AbstractThere is an increasingly pressing need, by several applications in
             diverse domains, for developing techniques able to index and mine very
             large collections of sequences, or data series. Examples of such
             applications come from the Inernet of Things, biology, astronomy,
             entomology, the web, and other domains. It is not unusual for these
             applications to involve numbers of data series in the order of hundreds
             of millions to billions, which are often times not analyzed in their
             full detail due to their sheer size.
             In this talk, we describe recent efforts in designing techniques for
             indexing and mining truly massive collections of data series that will
             enable scientists to easily analyze their data. We show that the main
             bottleneck in mining such massive datasets is the time taken to build
             the index, and we thus introduce solutions to this problem. Furthermore,
             we discuss novel techniques that adaptively create data series indexes,
             allowing users to correctly answer queries before the indexing task is
             finished. We also show how our methods allow mining on datasets that
             would otherwise be completely untenable, including the first published
             experiments using one billion data series.
             Finally, we present our vision for the future in big sequence management
             research.Speaker BioThemis Palpanas is a professor of computer science at the Paris
             Descartes University, France. He received the BS degree from the
             National Technical University of Athens, Greece, and the MSc and
             PhD degrees from the University of Toronto, Canada. He has
             previously held positions at the University of Trento and the IBM
             T.J. Watson Research Center. He has also been a Visiting Professor
             at the National University of Singapore, worked for the University
             of California, Riverside, and visited Microsoft Research and the
             IBM Almaden Research Center. His research solutions have been
             implemented in world-leading commercial data management products
             and he is the author of eight US patents. He is the recipient of
             three Best Paper awards (including ICDE and PERCOM), and the IBM

In the meantime,  in real-world applications, it is highly desirable to reduce the tedious, inefficient ETL (extraction, transformation, and loading) gap between tabular data processing systems and graph processing systems. Unfortunately, those challenges have not been easily met due to the intense memory pressure imposed by process-centric, message passing designs that many graph processing systems follow, as well as the separation of tabular data processing runtimes and graph processing runtimes.
             
             In this thesis, we first propose a bloat-aware design paradigm towards the development of efficient and scalable Big Data applications in object-oriented, GC enabled languages and demonstrate that programming under this paradigm does not incur significant programming burden but obtains remarkable performance gains (e.g., 2x). Based on the design paradigm, we then build Pregelix, an open source distributed graph processing system which is based on an iterative dataflow design that is better tuned to handle both in-memory and out-of-core workloads. As such, Pregelix offers improved performance characteristics and scaling properties over current open source systems (e.g., we have seen up to 15x speedup compared to Apache Giraph and up to 35x speedup compared to distributed GraphLab). Finally, we integrate Pregelix with the open source Big Data management system AsterixDB to offer users a mix of a vertex-oriented programming model and a declarative query language for richer forms of Big Graph analytics with reduced ETL pains.Speaker Bio

             important to a wide array of enterprise applications, ranging from
             Business Intelligence and Semantic Search to Data-as-a-Service. Such
             applications drive four main requirements for IE systems: accuracy,
             embeddability, scalability, transparency, and usability. In this talk
             I will give an overview of SystemT, a declarative IE system designed
             to address these requirements. SystemT ships today with multiple
             products across 4 IBM Software Brands and is used in multiple ongoing
             research projects.
             
             SystemT is based on the basic principle underlying relational database
             technology: complete separation of specification from execution.
             SystemT uses a declarative rule language, AQL, and an optimizer that
             generates high-performance algebraic execution plans for AQL rules. We
             show that SystemT removes the expressivity and performance limitations
             of previous state-of-art rule-based systems based on cascading
             grammars, delivering comparable result quality, and an order of
             magnitude higher annotation throughput with much lower memory
             footprint. We also present the ongoing research and development
             efforts in making SystemT more usable for both technical and business
             users.

For the most part, these developments were initially triggered by the requirements of Web 2.0 companies. Both technical and non-technical issues have continued to fuel the rapid pace of developments in the Big Data space. Open source and non-traditional software entities have played key roles in the latter. As it always happens with any emerging technology, there is a fair amount of hype that accompanies the work being done in the name of Big Data. The set of clear-cut distinctions that were made initially between Big Data systems and traditional database management systems are being blurred as the needs of the broader set  of (¡°real world¡±) users and developers have come into sharper focus in the last couple of years.

              networks is a challenging task for non-expert users. Due to their complex
              schemas and variational information descriptions, it becomes very hard for
              users to formulate a query that can be properly processed by the existing
              systems.  We argue that for a user-friendly graph query engine, it must
              support various kinds of transformations such as synonym, abbreviation, and
              ontology. Furthermore, the derived query results must be ranked in a
              principled manner.
         In this talk, we will review our recent efforts that address the usability
         and scalability issues arising in querying large, heterogeneous graph data
         from three perspectives: query formulation, query execution and result
         presentation.  Our goal is to build an integrated query infrastructure that
         mitigates the complexity of accessing graph data. It provides simple and
         intuitive query interfaces, including a schema-less query engine for
         keyword, graph pattern, and natural language queries. It also helps users
         digest query output quickly through query result summarization and
         continuously refines query results online based on user feedback. We will
         conclude the talk with new directions in managing and accessing graph data.

             and store them for a long time.
             This opens the possibility that kinds of demanding analysis like forecasting, formerly dependent on
             data warehouses and temporal databases, can become available to everyday applications in off-the-shelf data stores. The challenge is how to organize past states so that they are ``not in the way'' and ``always there'' when needed.
             
             Our  approach, called Retro, integrates a low-level consistent snapshot system into a data store
             storage manager, allowing to run unmodified data store programs against the snapshots, 
             side by side with programs running against the current state. The approach is attractive for several reasons.
             An application can take snapshots efficiently with any frequency, keep them indefinitely,
             or garbage-collect them at low cost, a useful feature in long-lived systems. 
             A principled methodology derives the snapshot protocols from the native data store storage manager mechanisms, allowing to implement the snapshot system in a modular way,
             without extensive modifications to the data store internals, making the approach suitable in off-the-shelf data 
             stores.
             The talk will describe the new techniques that underly Retro
             and present preliminary performance results from a prototype we built in Berkeley DB, indicating Retro
             is efficient, imposing moderate performance penalty on the native data store, on expected common workloads. Speaker BioLiuba Shrira is a Professor in the Computer Science Department at Brandeis University,

             engines, and transactional databases are built. Such services are trusted with
             irreplaceable personal and commercial information by users, companies, and even governments.
             The designers of storage services often have to choose between performance and reliability. If the developer
             makes the system reliable, performance is often significantly reduced. If the developer instead maximizes
             performance, a crash could lead to data loss and corruption.
             In this talk, I describe how to build systems that achieve both strong reliability and high performance. In many
             systems, reliability is maintained by carefully ordering updates to storage. The key insight is that the low-level
             mechanism used to enforce ordering is overloaded: it provides durability as well as ordering. I introduce a new
             primitive, osync(), that decouples ordering from durability of writes. I present Optimistic Crash Consistency,
             a new crash-recovery protocol that builds on osync() to provide strong reliability guarantees and high
             performance. I implement these techniques in the Optimistic File System (OptFS) and show that it provides
             10X increased performance for some workloads. With researchers in Microsoft, I employ the principles of
             Optimistic Crash Consistency in a distributed storage system, resulting in 2-5X performance improvements.Speaker BioVijay Chidambaram is a Ph.D candidate in the Department of Computer Sciences at the University of

Data feeds are a mechanism for having continuous data arrive into a BDMS from external sources and incrementally populate a persisted dataset and associated indexes. The need to persist and index "fast-flowing'' high-velocity data (and support ad hoc analytical queries) is ubiquitous. However, the state of the art today involves 'gluing' together different systems. AsterixDB is different in being a unified system with "native support'' for data  ingestion.
             
             We discuss the challenges and present the design and implementation of the concepts involved in modeling and managing data feeds in AsterixDB. AsterixDB allows the runtime behavior, allocation of resources, and the offered degree of robustness to be customized (by associating an ingestion policy) to suit the application(s) that wish to consume the ingested data. Results from  experiments that evaluate the scalability and fault-tolerance of the AsterixDB data feeds facility are reported. We include an evaluation of the built-in ingestion policies and study their effect as well on throughput and latency. An evaluation and comparison with a `glued' together system formed from popular engines - Storm (for streaming) and MongoDB (for persistence) - is also included.Speaker BioFeb. 27, 2015SPEAKER: Fatma Ozcan (IBM Research - Almaden)SQL Comes Back, But This is not Your Father's DBMS!DetailsDate and TimeFeb. 27, 2015 3 pmLocationDBH 3011SpeakerFatma Ozcan (IBM Research - Almaden)TitleSQL Comes Back, But This is not Your Father's DBMS!AbstractRecent years have seen the resurgence of SQL; this time in the context of Big Data Platforms. SQL-on-Hadoop
             was one of the hottest topics in 2014, with many newcomers, and adaptations of old systems. There
             are significant differences between the new incarnation of SQL systems, and the traditional enterprise
             warehouses. First, semi-structured data is inherent in the Hadoop data as the data frequently
             comes from noSQL and web sources. Hence JSON data and complex types are more important than in 
             traditional systems. Second, SQL is only one of the steps in the bigger analytical flows. This requires
             SQL to interact with other frameworks, including streaming, ETL, as well as advanced analytics and 
             machine learning. Finally, we see more user-defined function in big data platforms, because
             a lot of business logic needs to be executed closer to the data. 
              
              In this talk, I will first describe IBM Big SQL, an SQL-on-Hadoop offering that works on all Hadoop

Twitter identified the need for real time analytics early on and invested in a massive data pipeline that collects, aggregates, processes large volumes of data in real time. At the heart of the pipeline is Twitter Storm, a real-time stream processing engine widely used in Twitter. Storm is used for real-time data analytics, time series aggregation, and powering real-time features like trending topics. In this talk, we will give an overview of real time analytics, discuss the twitter real time data pipeline and how Storm is used for extracting analytics. We will also discuss the challenges we faced and lessons we have learned while building this infrastructure at Twitter. Speaker BioKarthik is the engineering manager and technical lead for Real Time Analytics at Twitter. He has two decades of experience working in parallel databases, big data infrastructure and networking. He cofounded Locomatix, a company that specializes in real timestreaming processing on Hadoop and Cassandra using SQL that was acquired by Twitter.

They now drive towards declarative, SQL-alike query languages. However, their idiomatic, non-SQL language constructs, the many variations and the lack of formal syntax and semantics pose problems. Notably, database vendors end up with unclear semantics and complicated implementations, as they add one feature at-a-time.
             
             The presented SQL++ semi-structured data model bridges JSON and the SQL data model. The SQL++ query language is backwards compatible with SQL, while supporting native JSON. SQL++ includes configuration options that describe different options of language semantics and formally capture the variations of existing database languages. SQL++ is unifying: By appropriate choices of configuration options, the SQL++ semantics can morph into the semantics of any of eleven popular semistructured databases, which we surveyed, as the experimental validation shows. In this way, SQL++ allows a formal characterization of the capabilities of the emerging query languages.
             
             We briefly discuss the key role of SQL++ and SQL++ Incremental View Maintenance in the FORWARD application and visualization development platform. SQL++ also is the query language of the FORWARD middleware query processor. We briefly discuss issues and opportunities in federated queries over SQL and non-SQL database.

In contrast to traditional relational databases, the LOD cloud does not provide a fixed, pre-defined schema. Rather, RDF allows for flexibly modeling the data schema by attaching RDF types to the entities and by using domain-specific RDF properties to describe the entities. The talk presents recent developments on the extraction and analysis of schema information from the LOD cloud. For example, with SchemEX, we have developed an efficient approach and tool for a stream-based extraction and indexing of schema information from Linked Open Data (LOD) at web-scale. The schema index provided by SchemEX can be used to locate distributed data sources in the LOD cloud. The SchemEX approach is used in LODatio, a Google-inspired search engine designed for data engineers to find relevant sources of LOD. Further analysis of schema structures on the LOD cloud include investigating the redundancy between type and property information, use of vocabularies in pay-level domains, and change of schema information over weekly snapshots of a larger amount of LOD data. The talk will conclude with current developments and future work.Speaker BioAnsgar Scherp is a professor at the Leibniz Information Center for Economics and Kiel University, Kiel, GermanyJan. 30, 2015SPEAKER: Chris Jermaine (Rice University)Large-Scale Machine Learning with the SimSQL SystemDetailsDate and TimeJan. 30, 2015 3 pmLocationDBH 3011SpeakerChris Jermaine (Rice University)TitleLarge-Scale Machine Learning with the SimSQL SystemAbstractIn this talk, I'll describe the SimSQL system, which is a platform for writing and executing statistical codes over large data sets, particularly for machine learning applications. Codes that run on SimSQL can be written in a very high-level, declarative language called Buds. A Buds program looks a lot like a mathematical specification of an algorithm, and statistical codes written in Buds are often just a few lines long.
             
             At its heart, SimSQL is really a relational database system, and like other relational systems, SimSQL is designed to support data independence. That is, a single declarative code for a particular statistical inference problem can be used regardless of data set size, compute hardware, and physical data storage and distribution across machines. One concern is that a platform supporting data independence will not perform well. But we've done extensive experimentation, and have found that SimSQL performs as well as other competitive platforms that support writing and executing machine learning codes for large data sets.Speaker BioChris Jermaine is an associate professor of computer science at Rice University.

Minimization Abstract Geographically annotated social media is extremely valuable for modern
information retrieval. However, when researchers can only access
publicly-visible data, one quickly finds that social media users
rarely publish location information. In this work, we provide a method
which can geolocate the overwhelming majority of active Twitter users,
independent of their location sharing preferences, using only
publicly-visible Twitter data.

Our method infers an unknown user's location by examining their
friend's locations. We frame the geotagging problem as an optimization
over a social network with a total variation-based objective and
provide a scalable and distributed algorithm for its solution.
Furthermore, we show how a robust estimate of the geographic
dispersion of each user's ego network can be used as a per-user
accuracy measure, allowing us to discard poor location inferences and
control the overall error of our approach.

Leave-many-out evaluation shows that our method is able to infer
location for 101,846,236 Twitter users at a median error of 6.38 km,
allowing us to geotag over 80% of public tweets.

related to real life events.  For this reason,  although still being a challenging task, the development of 
effective methods to retrieve these pictures is important. Recognizing this importance, and to improve 
the retrieval effectiveness of tag-based event retrieval systems, we have proposed a new 
effective method to extract a set of geographical tag features from raw geo-spatial profiles of user tags.  
The main idea is to use these features to select the best expansion terms in a machine learning-based
query expansion approach. Specifically, we apply rigorous statistical exploratory analysis of spatial 
point patterns to extract the geo-spatial features. Then, we used the features both to summarize the spatial 
characteristics of the spatial distribution of a single term, and to determine the similarity between 
the spatial profiles of two terms -- i.e., term-to-term spatial similarity. To further improve our image retrieval 
approach, we investigated the effect of combining our geo-spatial features with temporal features. 
In this presentation, I will try to give an overview of the methods we used
(1) to extract the spatio-temporal featrues from image tags, and (2) how to use these features to
improve the retrieval performance, focusing on retrieval of event-related images. Finally, I will
discuss the results from our experiments, and show how our method has improved the
state-of-the-art approach.Speaker BioHeri Ramampiaro is an Associate Professor at the Dept of Computer and Information Science,

Customers cannot easily switch technologies or adapt them to their needs without causing disruptions to their business. This is where software vendors are able to help. I will discuss how an ISV like Quest managed to go from startup to acquisition and the details of two of the relevant enterprise technologies. The first technology, database replication, has become critical in scaling many of the household names we know. We will explore this technology and its evolution from homogeneous database replication to heterogeneous database replication that includes Oracle, SQL Server, and Hadoop systems. The second technology, data reorganization, is crucial to curbing storage hungry databases and improving database performance by defragmenting data.

Its revolutionary potential is now universally recognized. Data complexity, heterogeneity, scale, and timeliness make data analysis a clear bottleneck in many biomedical applications, due to the complexity of the patterns and lack of scalability of the underlying algorithms. Advanced machine learning and data mining algorithms are being developed to address one or more challenges listed above. It is typical that the complexity of potential patterns may grow exponentially with respect to the data complexity, and so is the size of the pattern space. To avoid an exhaustive search through the pattern space, machine learning and data mining algorithms usually employ a greedy approach to search for a local optimum in the solution space, or use a branch-and-bound approach to seek optimal solutions, and consequently, are often implemented as iterative or recursive procedures. To improve efficiency, these algorithms often exploit the dependencies between potential patterns to maximize in-memory computation and/or leverage special hardware for acceleration. In this talk, I will present some open challenges faced by data scientist in biomedical fields and our approaches to tackle these challenges through examples such as multi-locus QTL analysis and transcriptome quantification using RNAseq data.

In the past several years, the lab has developed a variety of open-source software (e.g., Spark and MLBase) to integrate the three resources. For the People part, one of our main focuses is on data cleaning. Real-world data is often ¡°dirty¡±. Data cleaning is usually a tedious and time-consuming process which requires a lot of human work. In the AMPLab, we have exploited the use of crowdsourcing to reduce the human cost. While crowdsourcing makes data cleaning more scalable, it is still highly inefficient for large datasets. To overcome this limitation, we started the SampleClean project last year. The project aims to investigate how to obtain accurate query results from dirty data, by only cleaning a small sample of the data. We achieved this goal by marrying data cleaning with sampling-based approximate query processing, and addressing many challenging statistical issues. We build a new system that combines our work on crowdsourcing data cleaning and SampleClean query processing. An initial version of the system has shown that our system can help users to obtain very accurate query results on dirty data, at significantly reduced cleaning cost.

simple or small data operations).  It is motivated by the flurry of novel data
store designs ranging from SQL to NoSQL and NewSQL, Cache Augmented SQL, graph
databases and others.  More than 40 data stores have been introduced in the past
decade including systems contributed by the social networking sites,
e.g., Cassandra by Facebook and Voldemort by LinkedIn.  Some systems sacrifice
strict ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties and opt
for BASE (Basically Available, Soft-state, Eventual Consistency) to enhance
performance.  BG strives to compare these systems with one another quantitatively.

This  presentation details the design of BG and its SoAR metric to rate data stores.
We describe how BG quantifies the amount of unpredictable (stale, erroneous, or inconsistent)
data produced by a data store.  We present ratings from an industrial strength relational
database management system, a document store named MongoDB, a graph data store named
Neo4j, and an extensible data store named HBase.  We show the use of SoAR to evaluate
both vertical and horizontal scalability of MongoDB and HBase.  We also describe
the use of BG to evaluate novel cache replacement algorithms such as CAMP and
consistency frameworks such as IQ.  We conclude with the use of BG to demonstrate
a novel SQL middleware named KOSAR.

In prior work we implemented both a TC and DC that achieved modest performance. We recently built a high performance DC (the Bw-tree key value store) that achieves very high performance on modern hardware via latch-free and log structuring techniques and is currently shipping as an indexing and storage layer in Microsoft systems such as Hekaton and DocumentDB. The new DC executes operations more than 100x faster than the TC we previously implemented.  This talk describes how we achieved two orders of magnitude speedup in TC performance and shows that a full Deuteronomy stack can achieve very high performance overall. We built the TC using techniques analogous to the Bw-tree (latch-free data structures, log-structuring). The TC uses multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) to improve concurrency and performance.  Our new prototype TC scales to 32 cores on our 4 socket NUMA machine and commits more than a million of transactions per second for a variety of workloads.Speaker BioDavid Lomet has been a principal researcher and manager of the Database Group at Microsoft Research, Redmond since 1995.

Thanks to the explosion of Electronic Heart Records (EHR), the interest in building predictive models based on EHR data has skyrocketed in recent years.  There are some major challenges that remain to be addressed.  In this talk I will explore two of them. Effective algorithms are lacking in dealing with high-dimensional, longitudinal, sparse, inaccurate and inconsistent EHR data. The methodologies to develop predictive models are still labor intensive and ad-hoc. These rudimentary approaches are hindering the quality and throughput of healthcare and biomedical research.
In this talk, we promote a holistic approach that addresses both challenges by combining 1) algorithm development and 2) system building. We believe that a more robust and domain specific big-data platform could significantly speedup the development of robust and accurate predictive models for biomedical research. 
I will present different projects covering both aspects of such a platform:

Each new development seems to be subject to exuberant hyperbole.  The latest round is focusing on embedded electronics and is called The
Internet of Things, or just "The IoT."  The main force powering this "hype machine" is the suggestion of vast new commercial opportunities, estimated by some sources to be in the range of $19 Trillion. This talk begins with the conclusion that the "hype" about The Internet of Things is underplayed, and that the commercial implications of The Internet of Things are the smallest parts of a bigger story.  It compares The IoT to other historical technological developments, examining what is similar, and what is without historical precedent.  In particular, it finds the impact of applications of The Internet of Things to be spectacularly unconstrained.  All this leads to the idiom "Careful what you wish for."  So, while commerce is "wishing for" a $19 Trillion market, our society, and our economy, are going to get something else. The talk concludes with an examination of some of the potential unintended consequences of The Internet of Things.  It predicts that areas as diverse as Brand Management, Advertising, Propaganda, Healthcare, Law Enforcement, Insurance, Automobile ownership, Politics, and Warfare, to name just a few, will all be affected in ways few are considering.

Storage of this data and its subsequent analysis have posed significant challenges. Unlike the business data that drove research and development of relational databases for the past several decades, Web and Social data tend to have rich and varying structure, making traditional database systems a poor choice for their management. The astronomical size and semi-structured nature of this new data has forced companies in the business of managing it to look for other cost-effective solutions. In 2004 Google presented the MapReduce system as a way to harness the power of thousands of commodity machines to solve problems like building a search index over the entire World Wide Web in reasonable time at reasonable cost; MapReduce turned out to be a useful tool for performing other parallel computations over large amounts of data while presenting a simple programming model to users. Soon after the MapReduce paper, the open source community created the Hadoop platform to resemble Google's MapReduce system. Hadoop soon became a popular platform for processing large amounts of data using commodity computers. In an effort to boost user productivity, new declarative languages were designed and built to compile high-level declarative queries down to Hadoop MapReduce programs, making Hadoop the de-facto runtime layer for large-scale parallel data computation.

While widely used and popular today, Hadoop was not intentionally designed to be a runtime layer for higher-level declarative languages.
In this talk we explore an alternative to the Hadoop platform whose design is rooted in parallel database research from the 1980s and 1990s. Hyracks is an efficient runtime platform that accepts data-parallel jobs from users and from high-level language compilers and executes them on a cluster of commodity machines. We describe the design of Hyracks as well as salient aspects of its implementation. Using Hyracks we study the trade offs involved in building an extensible and reusable set of runtime components for large-scale data processing. We show experimentally that Hyracks is a highly configurable platform and well-suited for several different data processing tasks. We do so via three different use cases: executing queries expressed in high-level declarative languages, running actual Hadoop jobs using the Hadoop Compatibility Layer of Hyracks, and finally, running parallel graph computations using Pregelix, an open source graph analytics platform that uses Hyracks and emulates Google's Pregel programming model for analyzing large graphs in parallel.

A number of new declarative parallel languages have been proposed for querying and analyzing very large data sets.
To aid with the construction of declarative parallel query compilers, we propose an extensible algebraic framework called Algebricks. Algebricks is a model-agnostic compilation framework that provides the ability for a compiler to inject its own semantics in an extensible manner. Algebricks includes a reusable and extensible set of logical and physical operators and a large set of general purpose rewrite rules useful to most query compilers. We describe the implementation of three different language compilers (AsterixDB for AQL, Hivesterix for HiveQL, and VXQuery for XQuery) that use the Algebricks compiler framework to create parallel jobs to run on a Hyracks Cluster.Speaker BioMay. 2, 2014SPEAKER: Dick Bulterman (FXPAL)Authoring Support for Social Media Interaction:

Understanding Compound Multimedia DependenciesAbstract	   Creating compelling multimedia content is a difficult task. It involves not only the creative process 

of developing a compelling media-based story, but it also requires significant technical support for 

content editing and management. This process is made more complex by an increased desire for 

media personalization: the story you tell Mom about an event may be different than the version 

you¡¯d like to share with your friends. It is also different from the version you¡¯d like to tell your own 

children 15 years after the event had taken place. The makes media authoring a context- and time-
sensitive problem. No wonder most researchers analyze media instead of create it!

It is tempting to categorize multimedia authoring in terms of component areas: media encoding, 

media storage, media access, media transport, media rendering and overall presentation 

composition and control. Unfortunately, this partitioning blurs the dependencies that exist among 

these component areas that ultimately determine the success of an authoring system. Using the 

broad problem of social media interaction as an example, this talk will consider the composite 

effects of creating and accessing and transporting and presenting rich media objects for use by non-
technical end users.

The talk will survey several approaches to describe and manage media interactions. We will focus 

on the temporal modelling of context-sensitive personalized interactions of complex collections of 

independent media objects. Using the concepts of ¡®togetherness¡¯ being employed in the EU¡¯s FP-7 

project TA2: Together Anywhere, Together Anytime, we will follow the process of media capture, 

profiling, composition, sharing and end-user manipulation. We will consider the promise of using 

automated tools and contrast this with the reality of letting real users manipulation presentation 

semantics in real time.

The talk will not present a closed form solution, but will present a series of topics and problems that 

can stimulate the development of a new generation of systems to stimulate social media interaction.      Speaker Bio Dr. Dick Bulterman is President of the FX Palo Alto Laboratory (FXPAL) and professor of

Data represented in the form of sets of counts is easy to acquire and 
can be surprisingly useful in practice. For example, a simple way to 
represent a set of documents is as a "bag of words" where each document 
is represented just by the counts of words that occur in the document, a 
representation that has been the basis for many successful applications 
of machine learning to text data. In this talk we will review some 
important developments over the past 10 years in modeling data 
represented in the form of counts, combining ideas from statistics and 
machine learning. The talk will describe the general principles involved 
and then illustrate how these ideas can be applied to text documents, 
email communications, and social networks, including recent work in my 
research group. The talk will conclude with some speculative comments on 
future directions.

Semantic Computing (SC) is an emerging field that addresses computing
technologies which allow users to search, create, manipulate and connect
computational resources (including data, documents, tools, people, agents,
devices, etc.) based on semantics.

Semantic Computing includes the computing technologies (e.g., artificial
intelligence, natural language, software engineering, data and knowledge
engineering, computer systems, signal processing, etc.), and their
interactions, that may be used to extract or process computational content
and descriptions. While some areas of Semantic Computing have appeared as
pieces in different disciplines, Semantic Computing glues these pieces
together into an integrated theme with synergetic interactions. It
addresses not only the analysis and transformation of signals (e.g.,
pixels, words) into useful information, but also how such information can
be accessed and used to synthesize new signals.

The National Science Foundation has approved the planning of an
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Semantic
Computing currently involving UCI, UCSD and UCLA. The missions of the
I/UCRC are to develop semantic technologies that may facilitate the
transition of the Internet into its next generation, and develop new
business models to stimulate, strengthen, and grow the economy.

An important outcome of this I/UCRC is a Semantic Problem Solving Network
(SPSN) which is a public consortium of resources from all domains
including data, documents, devices, products, services, and people. The
resources are interconnected and integrated with a service-oriented
architecture and a semantic layer to help the public to solve general
problems and professional users to solve domain specific problems (e.g.,
finance, IT, health, defense, entertainment, education, manufacturing).

This talk will introduce Semantic Computing and its applications, the
operations of the I/UCRC, the architecture of the SPSN, how companies and
academic researchers can join or affiliate with the I/UCRC and SPSN, and
how companies and academic researchers can benefit.

LLAMA is a subsystem designed for new hardware environments that supports an API for page-oriented access methods, providing both cache and storage management. Caching (CL) and storage (SL) layers use a common mapping table that separates a page¡¯s logical and physical location. CL supports data updates and management updates (e.g., for index re-organization) via latch-free compare-and-swap atomic state changes on its mapping table. SL uses the same mapping table to cope with page location changes produced by log structuring on every page flush. To demonstrate LLAMA¡¯s suitability, we tailored our latch-free Bw-tree implementation to use LLAMA. The Bw-tree is a B-tree style index. Layered on LLAMA, it has higher performance and scalability using real workloads compared with BerkeleyDB¡¯s B-tree, which is known for good performance.

A new wave of systems is emerging in the space of Big Data Analytics that open the door to programming models beyond Hadoop MapReduce (HMR). It is well understood that HMR is not ideal for applications in the domain of machine learning and graph processing. This realization is fueling a number of new (Big Data) system efforts: Berkeley Spark, Google Pregel, GraphLab (CMU), and AsterixDB (UC Irvine), to name a few. Each of these add unique capabilities, but form islands around key functionalities: fault-tolerance, resource allocation, and data caching. In this talk, I will provide an overview of some Big Data systems starting with Google's MapReduce, which defined the foundational architecture for processing large data sets. I will then identify a key limitation in this architecture; namely, its inability to efficiently support iterative workflows. I will then describe real-world examples of systems that aim to fill this computational void. I will conclude with a description of my own work on a layering that unifies key runtime functionalities (fault-tolerance, resource allocation, data caching, and more) for workflows (both iterative and acyclic) that process large data sets.

real-world entity. Recent work has applied crowdsourcing to EM, and
has clearly established the promise of this approach. This work
however is limited in that it crowdsources only parts of the EM
workflow, requiring a developer who knows how to code to execute the
remaining parts. Consequently, this work does not scale to the growing
EM need at enterprises and crowdsourcing startups, and cannot handle
scenarios where ordinary users (i.e., the masses) want to leverage
crowdsourcing to match entities.

To address these problems, we propose the notion of hands-off
crowdsourcing (HOC), which crowdsources the entire workflow of a task,
thus requiring no developers. We show how HOC can represent a next
logical direction for crowdsourcing research, scale up EM at
enterprises and crowdsourcing startups, and open up crowdsourcing for
the masses. We describe Corleone, a HOC solution for EM. We show how
Corleone uses the crowd to generate blocking rules, applies active
learning to learn matchers, estimates accuracy given severe skew, and
identifies difficult-to-match pairs to which Corleone can apply more
complex matchers. Finally, we discuss the implications of our work to
executing crowdsourced RDBMS joins, cleaning learning models, and
soliciting complex information types from crowd workers.

While Big Data promises significant economic and social benefits, it also raises serious privacy concerns.  Real-time aggregate statistics of data collected from individuals can be shared to enable many applications such as disease surveillance and traffic monitoring.  However, it must be ensured that the privacy of individuals is not compromised.  While differential privacy has emerged as a de facto standard for private data analysis, directly applying the differential privacy mechanisms on time-series has limited utility due to high correlations between data values.  In this talk, I will present FAST, a novel Filtering and Adaptive Sampling based framework for monitoring aggregate Time-series under differential privacy.  FAST adaptively samples long time-series according to detected data dynamics and simultaneously uses filtering techniques to dynamically predict and correct released data values.  I will present experimental studies using real datasets demonstrating the feasibility and benefit of FAST and conclude with open questions.

We want this new "product", to be called AsterixDB, to be very high quality - and we are hereby inviting interested helpers at UCI to come hear about it and then help us polish it by downloading it and playing with it - trying out its data model, query language, and API for apps - kicking its tires - this Friday!  Our goal is to get a handful of "outside the team" folks to join us in using the system ahead of the Beta Release and then filing any issues using the GoogleCode issue tracking infrastructure - so that when we release this publically, it's well-polished and well shaken out.  (To date we have only delivered an Alpha Release, and only very recently, to one of our industrial partners.)  So - if you like database technology and would like to help us deliver "Big Data 2.0" to the world in a month or so - and you have time/interest in playing a bit in the very near term - PLEASE COME FRIDAY and we will show you what AsterixDB is all about!  This will be an informal presentation, based on giving a tour of our Alpha documentation and the release info on the GoogleCode wiki, and then having the team give a demo and even help you get the system working in real time if you bring your favorite laptop when you come.  We hope to see some of you there! (Refreshments will be provided, as usual for the ISG seminar, but we might upgrade the refreshments a little for this event; we'll see. We will also surely do something nice later for any outside folks who do end up significantly contributing in this manner to the quality of the release.)  If you plan to come on Friday, please RSVP to the speaker (mjcarey@ics.uci.edu) so we know what to maybe expect in terms of potential turnout.  Thx!

It
used to be that everything you cared about ran on a single database and the transaction system presented you the abstraction of a singularity;
your transaction happened at a single point in space (the database) and a single point in time (it looked like it was before or after all other transactions).

Now, we see a more complicated world.  Across the Internet, we put up HTML documents or send SOAP calls and these are not in a transaction.  Within a cluster, we typically write files in a file system and then read them later in a big map-reduce job that sucks up read-only files, crunches, and writes files as output.  Even inside the emerging many-core systems, we see high-performance computation on shared memory but increasing cost to using semaphores.  Indeed, it is clear that "Shared Memory Works Great as Long as You Don't Actually SHARE Memory".

There are emerging solutions which are based on immutable data.  It seems we need to look back to our grandparents and how they managed distributed work in the days before telephones.  We realize that "Accountants Don't Use Erasers" but rather accumulate immutable knowledge and then offer interpretations of their understanding based on the limited knowledge presented to them.  This talk will explore a number of the ways in which our new distributed systems leverage write-once and read-many immutable data.

The development of Espresso was motivated by our desire to migrate LinkedIn¡¯s online serving infrastructure from monolithic, commercial, RDBMS systems running on high cost specialized hardware to elastic clusters of commodity servers running free software; and to improve agility by enabling rapid development by simplifying the programming model, separating scalability, routing, caching from business logic. Espresso is a document-oriented distributed data serving platform that has been built to address LinkedIn¡¯s requirements for a scalable, performant, source-of-truth primary store. It provides a hierarchical document model, transactional support for modifications to related documents, real- time secondary indexing, on-the-fly schema evolution and provides a timeline consistent change capture stream.

Our framework utilizes the spatio-temporal statistical properties of an observed phenomena, with the goal of maximizing an application specified reward. Specifically, we define an observation of a phenomena by assigning it a discrete value (state) and we model its semantics as the transition between these values (states). This semantic model is used to predict the future states in which the phenomena is likely to be at, based on partially observed past states. To accomplish real-time agility, we designed an approximate, adaptive-grid solution for POMDPs that yields practically good results, and in some cases, guarantees on the quality of the approximation. We instantiate the framework in a camera network and use it perform real- time actuation of large-scale sensor networks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the problem of actuating a large scale sensor network based on an approximated POMDP formulation. Our semantic model is simple enough to be implemented in real-time, yet powerful enough to capture meaningful semantics of typical behavior. Our action selection process is as fast as a table lookup in real-time.

Flash storage is poised to take a large
chunk of the market, having grown significantly in capacity and production, driven by consumer electronics.
Flash's technical advantages over disk promise storage arrays that are faster and easier to use while consuming less power and costing less.

The downsides of flash (inc. large erase blocks, limited overwrites, and higher price) mean that using flash as a drop-in
replacement for disk leads to increased price, volatile performance, and decreased reliability.
In this talk, we describe the design of the Pure FlashArray, an enterprise storage array built around consumer flash storage.
The array and its software, Purity, play to the advantages of flash while minimizing the downsides. Purity writes to flash
in multiples of the erase block size and stores its metadata in a key-value store that minimizes overwrites and stores approximate
answers, trading extra reads for fewer writes. And, Purity reduces data stored on flash through a range of techniques, including
compression, deduplication, and thin provisioning.

The net result is a flash array that deliver a sustained read-write workload of over 100,000 4kb I/O requests per second while
maintaining sub-millisecond latency. With many customers seeing 4x or greater data reduction, the Pure FlashArray ends up
being cheaper than disk too.

Any modern software system of note has two key characteristics: it is a distributed system, and it manages significant amounts of data.  As a result, the topic of distributed data consistency has become a key problem in the engineering of modern software systems.  Conventional distributed systems wisdom dictates that perfect consistency is too expensive to guarantee in general, and consistency mechanisms¡ªif they are used at all¡ªshould be reserved for infrequent, small-scale, mission-critical tasks.   Like most design maxims, these ideas are not so easy to translate into practice; all kinds of unavoidable tactical questions pop up.  For example:

 ? Exactly where in my multifaceted system is loose consistency ¡°good enough¡± to meet application needs?
 ? How do I know that my ¡°mission-critical¡± software isn¡¯t tainted by my ¡°best effort¡± components?
 ? How do I ensure that my design maxims are maintained as software and developer teams evolve?

Until recently, answers to these questions have been more a matter of folklore than mathematics.

In this talk, I will describe the CALM Theorem, which links Consistency And Logical Monotonicity, and discuss how it can inform distributed software development.  I'll also describe Bloom, a "disorderly" distributed programming language developed in my group.  Bloom admits a form of automated CALM analysis, which enables a compiler to answer questions like the ones above.    

Time permitting, I will also point out some additional results from my two main research projects: the BOOM project on large-scale system development, and the d^p project on human interaction in the data analysis lifecycle.

This is cited as the central reason why many federal, healthcare, and financial organizations have  not embraced cloud computing in a major way in spite of its many benefits. In this talk we consider the central problem of "data confidentiality", that arises while storing sensitive data in the cloud. While data encryption is an obvious solution for ensuring confidentiality, standard algorithms like AES make the data unusable in the cloud. For example, keyword search or database queries cannot be evaluated against the encrypted data. Over the past decade, many new schemes have been developed, that admit a variety of computations directly on the encrypted representation.  We give a brief overview of some of the important techniques proposed in this arena, specifically, for evaluating keyword-match and range queries. Finally, we describe our own contributions to this area and conclude with a discussion about open problems and future directions.Speaker Bio

In this talk, we examine this trade-off in the context of quorum-replicated data stores. Under partial, or non-strict quorum replication, a data store waits for responses from a subset of replicas before answering a query, without guaranteeing that read and write replica sets intersect. As deployed in practice, these configurations provide only basic eventual consistency guarantees, with no limit to the recency of data returned. However, anecdotally, partial quorums are often ¡°good enough¡± for practitioners given their latency benefits.

We explain why partial quorums are regularly acceptable in practice, analyzing both the staleness of data they return and the latency benefits they offer. We introduce Probabilistically Bounded Staleness (PBS) consistency, which provides expected bounds on staleness with respect to both versions and wall clock time. We derive a closed-form solution for versioned staleness as well as model real-time staleness for representative Dynamo-style systems under internet-scale production workloads. Using PBS, we measure the latency-consistency trade-off for partial quorum systems. We quantitatively demonstrate how and why eventually consistent systems frequently return consistent data within tens of milliseconds while offering significant latency benefits.

This is joint work with Shivaram Venkataraman, Mike Franklin, Joe Hellerstein, and Ion Stoica at UC Berkeley.

Recently, there are more and more demands for analyzing Big Graph Data.  For example,  the scale of the world wide web keeps expanding to billions of web pages and hyper-links, the key social network sites like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter all have a rapidly growing gigantic social graph, and the biology science people assemble genomes from huge de Bruijn graphs.  To analyze such Big graphs requires a system which can not only scale out to hundreds or thousands of machines, but also do the computation very efficiently.  In this talk, I will introduce the Pregelix system,  which supports easy programming and scales to large commodity machine clusters. I will first illustrate the programming model -- application programmers need zero knowledge of the parallel/distributed system,  but just "think like a vertex" and write a couple of functions that encapsulate the logic for what one graph vertex does.  After that, I will detail the shining internals of Pregelix,  including the system architecture,  the scalable dataflow runtime,  the execution strategies, and the out-of-core support.  Then,  I will walk through a few examples built on top of Pregelix, such as PageRank and connected components.  Finally I will demonstrate our performance numbers and conclude the talk.

Within the past few years, industrial and academic organizations designed a wealth of systems for data-intensive analytics including MapReduce, SCOPE/Dryad, ASTERIX, Stratosphere, Spark, and many others. These systems are being applied to new applications from diverse domains other than (traditional) relational OLAP, making it difficult to understand the tradeoffs between them and the workloads for which they were built. We present a taxonomy of existing system stacks based on their architectural components and the design choices made related to data processing and programmability to sort this space. We further demonstrate a web repository for sharing Big Data analytics platform information and use cases. The repository enables researchers and practitioners to store and retrieve data and queries for their use case, and to easily reproduce experiments from others on different platforms, simplifying comparisons.

 Data from real-world applications is regarded as the golden standard for database systems evaluation. Unfortunately, finding appropriate real-world datasets is often hard due to various privacy-related constraints. To overcome this problem, we developed the Myriad Parallel Data Generator Toolkit - a generic toolkit for declarative specification of synthetic data generators that provides built-in parallelization support for the specified data generation programs. In this talk, I will motivate and present the main technical challenges solved by the highly-parallel execution model of the Myriad Toolkit. In addition, to demonstrate the usability of the toolkit, I will also give a brief overview of the supported data generator specification syntax and explain how different statistical constraints for the generated data can be implemented using the appropriate combination of specification routines.

 Parallel data flow systems are a central part of most analytic pipelines for big data. The iterative nature of many analysis and machine learning algorithms, however, is still a challenge for current systems. While certain types of bulk iterative algorithms are supported by novel data flow frameworks, these systems cannot exploit computational dependencies present in many algorithms, such as graph algorithms. As a result, these algorithms are inefficiently executed and have led to specialized systems based on other paradigms, such as message passing or shared memory. We propose a method to integrate "incremental iterations", a form of workset iterations, with parallel data flows. After showing how to integrate bulk iterations into a dataflow system and its optimizer, we present an extension to the programming model for incremental iterations. The extension alleviates for the lack of mutable state in dataflows and allows for exploiting the "sparse computational dependencies" inherent in many iterative algorithms. The evaluation of a prototypical implementation shows that those aspects lead to up to two orders of magnitude speedup in algorithm runtime, when exploited. In our experiments, the improved dataflow system is highly competitive with specialized systems while maintaining a transparent and unified data flow abstraction.

Many systems for big data analytics employ a data flow programming abstraction to define parallel data processing tasks. In this setting, custom operations expressed as user-defined functions are very common. We address the problem of performing data flow optimization at this level of abstraction, where the semantics of operators are not known. Traditionally, query optimization is applied to queries with known algebraic semantics. In this work, we find that a handful of properties, rather than a full algebraic specification, suffice to establish reordering conditions for data processing operators. We show that these properties can be accurately estimated for black box operators using a shallow static code analysis pass based on reverse data and control flow analysis over the general-purpose code of their user-defined functions. We design and implement an optimizer for parallel data flows that does not assume knowledge of semantics or algebraic properties of operators. Our evaluation confirms that the optimizer can apply common rewritings such as selection reordering, bushy join order enumeration, and limited forms of aggregation push-down, hence yielding similar rewriting power as modern relational DBMS optimizers. Moreover, it can optimize the operator order of non-relational data flows, a unique feature among today's systems.

            In this talk, we describe the CloudProtect system from the recently accepted paper in IEEE Cloud 2012. The CloudProtect middleware empowers users to encrypt sensitive data stored within various cloud applications. However, most web applications require data in plaintext for implementing the various functionalities and in general, do not support encrypted data management. Therefore, CloudProtect strives to carry out the data transformations (encryption/decryption) in a manner that is transparent to the application, i.e., preserves all functionalities of the application, including those that require data to be in plaintext. Additionally, CloudProtect allows users flexibility in trading off performance for security in order to let them optimally balance their privacy needs and usage-experience.
            This paper explores an efficient and secure mechanism
            to partition computations across public and private
            machines in a hybrid cloud setting. We propose a principled
            framework for distributing data and processing in a hybrid
            cloud that meets the conflicting goals of performance, sensitive
            data disclosure risk and resource allocation costs. The proposed
            solution is implemented as an add-on tool for a Hadoop and
            Hive based cloud computing infrastructure. Our experiments
            demonstrate that the developed mechanism can lead to a
            major performance gain by exploiting both the hybrid cloud
            components without violating any pre-determined public cloud
            usage constraints.

large volumes of data remains a fundamental challenge.  We are building a

record-level provenance from these data-intensive scalable compute (DISC)
systems in a generic manner.  Developers leverage a unique API to
instrument these systems, actively capturing fine-grain lineage across
multi-step, perhaps non-relational, transformations.   We report on our 
experiences instrumenting Hyracks and Hadoop, and find that Newt's capture 
incurs 16-26% time overheads for the PigMix benchmark and a 14% overhead

            	Can we improve on the work that received the 10 year ACM SIGMOD test of time award? In this talk, we will outline our preliminary approach at doing the entire query processing on the server/cloud, while the client is involved only with encryption, and decryption. Our work is based on Craig Gentry's revolutionary recent work on fully homomorphic encryption (first such scheme was published in 2009). We utilize Craig Gentry's scheme for query processing, while maintaining the algebraic framework that is a key aspect of database systems. There are several avenues for future investigation: exploring physical implementations for algebraic operators beyond what we have investigated; exploring query optimization and utilization of indexes; exploring feasibility of Craig Gentry's fully homomorphic encryption in the context of databases as some aspects of his scheme are very time consuming.

questions: How does data get into the system? What primitives
should we provide to better cope with dirty/noisy data? How can
we support efficient data analysis on spatial data? Using real examples,
we show the capabilities of ASTERIX for ingesting data via
feeds, supporting set-similarity predicates for fuzzy matching, and

in recent years due to its simplicity and power. In an instant-
search system, every keystroke from a user triggers a new
request to the server. Therefore, its log has a richer content
than that of a traditional search system, and previous log
analysis research is not applicable to this type of log. In
this study, we present the problem of analyzing the query
log of an instant-search system. We propose a classification
scheme for user typing behaviors. We also compare the log
of an instant-search system and that of a traditional search
system on the same data. The results show that on a people
directory search system, instant search can typically save
2 seconds per search, reduce the typing effort by showing
the results with fewer characters entered, and increase the

            		Geospatial queries (GQ) have been used in a wide variety of applications such as decision support systems, profile-based marketing, bioinformatics and GIS. Most of the existing query-answering approaches assume non parallel processing on a single machine although GQs are intrinsically parallelizable. There are some approaches that have been designed for parallel databases and cluster systems; however, these only apply to the systems with limited parallel processing capability, far from that of cloud-based platforms. In this study, I present the problem of parallel geospatial query processing with MapReduce programming model.  Our approach creates a spatial index, Voronoi diagram, for given data points in 2D space and enables efficient processing of GQs. We evaluated the performance of our proposed techniques and correspondingly compared them with their closest related work while varying the number of employed nodes.

In particular, I focus on solutions for synchronization problem in multisimulation to orchestrate consistent information flow through multiple simulator: (1) a transaction-based approach to modeling the synchronization problem in multisimulations by mapping it to a problem similar to multidatabase concurrency; we express multisimulation synchronization as a scheduling problem where the goal is to generate ¡°correct schedules¡± for time advancement and data exchange across simulators that meets the dependencies without loss of concurrency, (2) a hybrid scheduling strategy which adapts itself to the ¡°right¡± level of pessimism/optimism based on the state of the execution and underlying dependencies, and (3) relaxation model for dependencies which guarantee bounded violation of consistency to support higher levels of concurrency. We also develop two key optimizations: (a) efficient checkpointing/rollback techniques, and (b) relaxation model for dependencies which guarantee bounded violation of consistency to support higher levels of concurrency. We evaluate our proposed techniques via a detailed case study from the emergency response domain by integrating three disparate simulators ¨C a fire simulator (CFAST), an evacuation simulator (Drillsim) and a communication simulator (LTEsim).

In the first part of the talk, I'll describe our ongoing research in leveraging human computation for tasks related to data. Human computation ("crowdsourcing") augments traditional computation with the use of human abilities to solve sub-problems that are difficult for computers, e.g., object or image comparisons, information extraction, relevance judgements, and data gathering. We are addressing two different types of data-centric human computation: (1) Fundamental algorithms, such as sorting, clustering, and data cleaning, in which the basic operations (e.g., compare, filter) are performed by humans. (2) A database-system like platform in which declarative queries are posed by users, and the system orchestrates a combination of stored and crowdsourced data to answer them. Common to both areas is the need to formalize and optimize new tradeoffs among latency (humans are much slower than computers), cost (humans require real money to perform tasks), and quality (humans are inaccurate and inconsistent).
In the second part of the talk, I'll describe my recent experience teaching introductory databases to 60,000 students. Admittedly only 25,000 of them submitted their homework, and a mere 6500 achieved a strong final score. But even with 6500 students, I more than quadrupled the total number of students I've taught in my entire 18-year academic career. I began by "flipping" the way I teach my Stanford course and, as a side-effect, making all components of the course freely available online. But the big inflection point came when I offered the online course in a structured fashion with a schedule, automatically-graded assignments and exams, and most importantly a worldwide community of students. I'll cover a variety of topics related to the massive online course, both logistical and social, while avoiding speculation on the future of higher education.

for Transportation Decision-Making), which enables real-time integration, visualization, querying, and
analysis of dynamic and archived transportation data. I will show that considering the large size of the
transportation data, variety of the data (different modalities and resolutions), and frequent changes of the
data, implementation of such a scalable system that allows for effective querying and analysis of both
archived and real-time data is an intrinsically challenging data management task. Subsequently, I will
focus on a route-planning problem where the weights on the road-network edges vary as a function of
time due to the variability of traffic congestion. I will show that na?ve approaches to address this problem
are either inaccurate or slow, motivating the need for new solutions. Consequently, I will discuss our

For example a recent Cisco report indicates that mobile data traffic will increase 39 times by 2015, while 66% of such boost is due to video traffic. Network capacity issue may be partially coped by deploying more cellular base stations, installing dedicated broadcast networks, or upgrading the cellular base stations to support 4G. However, these approaches all result in additional costs on new network infrastructure, and might not be fully compatible with existing
obile devices. Also, according to the report, the network capacity provided by cellular network providers is predicted to be only 10 time increasing by 2015, which implies that the above methods do not still meet the requirement for increasing mobile traffic. A better way is moving data to other networks to reduce heavy traffic in cellular networks. In our research, we study motivations and methods to offload part of mobile traffic from cellular networks to other networks such as WiFi or Ad Hoc, which are available in most modern smartphones. Such these methods are cheap, practical, and easily implemented.March. 1, 2012 (Special Time\Place)SPEAKER: Archan Misra (Singapore Management University) Real-time Mobile Sensing/Analytics and the LiveLabs Experimentation PlatformDetailsDate and TimeMarch. 1, 2012 (Special Time\Place) 11 amLocationDBH 4011SpeakerArchan Misra (Singapore Management University) TitleReal-time Mobile Sensing/Analytics and the LiveLabs Experimentation PlatformAbstract

            Data management workloads are increasingly write-intensive and subject
to strict latency SLAs.  This presents a dilemma: Traditional update
in place systems have unmatched latency properties but poor write
throughput.  In contrast, existing log structured techniques
significantly improve write throughput but generally sacrifice read
performance and exhibit unacceptable latency spikes.

We begin by presenting a new performance metric: read fanout, and
argue that, along with read amplification and write amplification, it
better characterizes the real-world performance of index algorithms than
existing approaches such as asymptotic analysis and price/performance.

We then present a Log Structured Merge (LSM) tree implementation that
combines the best properties of B-Trees and log structured approaches:
(1) Unlike existing log structured trees, our implementation has
near-optimal read and scan performance, and (2) we present merge
algorithms that bound write latencies without impacting write
throughput or allowing merges to block application writes for extended
periods of time.  We do this by introducing a new ``spring and gear''
scheduler that ensures merges at each level of the tree make steady
progress.  This allows us to avoid blocking application writes without
resorting to techniques that degrade read performance.

We use Bloom filters to improve index performance, and find that a
number of subtleties arise.  First, it is important to ensure that
reads can safely stop after finding the first version of a record.
Otherwise, frequently written items will incur multiple disk
lookups.  Second, many applications and data management architectures
check for preexisting values at insertion time.  Avoiding the disk
seek performed by the check is crucial for such applications.

This work will appear in Sigmod 2012.

The FORWARD project replaces such low level code with declarative specifications. Its cornerstones are 
(i) the unified application state virtual database, which enables modeling and manipulating the entire application state in an extension of SQL, named SQL++ 
(ii) specification of Ajax pages as essentially rendered views over the unified application state.
Consequently the following three problems are resolved by appropriate reduction to data management problems, where prior database research literature is leveraged and extended.
1. The partial change of Ajax pages, in response to application state changes, is reduced to an incremental view maintenance problem. Id's that retain the provenance of the page data play an instrumental efficiency role.
2. Efficient data access is reduced to semistructured query processing over an integrated view that involves large database(s) and small main memory-based sources.
3. The inherent location transparency of the specifications is exploited in order to perform computation at the appropriate location (browser vs server). More broadly, the talk discusses ongoing and future work in utilizing the increased abilities of HTML5 clients towards achieving low latency mobile web applications applications, while location transparency of the specifications is retained.Speaker Bio

These systems hold their data in one or a relatively small number of computers. With a tightly defined schema and transactional consistency, the results returned from queries are crisp and accurate.
New systems have humongous amounts of data content, change rates, and querying rates and take lots of computers to hold and process. The data quality and meaning are fuzzy. The schema, if present, is likely to vary across the data. The origin of the data may be suspect, and its staleness may vary.
Today's data systems coalesce data from many sources. The Internet, B2B, and enterprise application integration (EAI) combine data from different places. No computer is an island. This large amount of interconnectivity and interdependency has led to a relaxation of many database principles. 
In this talk, consider the some of the ways in which today's answers differ from what we used to expect.

The need for efficient data generation for the purposes of testing and benchmarking newly developed data-intensive computing systems has increased with the emergence of
big data problems. As synthetic data model specifications evolve over time the data generator programs implementing these models have to be continuously adapted ¨C
 a task that might become complex as the set of model constraints grows. This talk presents Myriad - a new parallel data generation toolkit. Data generators created
  with the toolkit can produce very large datasets by exploiting a completely parallel execution model, while at the same time maintain cross-partition dependencies, correlations and distributions in the generated data. 
In addition, I report on our efforts towards a benchmark suite for large-scale parallel analysis systems that uses Myriad for the generation of large social network graphs and OLAP-style relational datasets.

and "words on the page" ranking analysis. That system quickly failed,
being far too easy to game. Search 2.0 gave us ranking where links
were used as votes; Search 3.0, a third generational system,
introduced blending vertical search results with web matches.

Research)TitleScal(a)ing up Machine Learning and Graph-based AnalyticsAbstract
Machine learning practitioners are increasingly interested in applying their algorithms to Big Data. Unfortunately, current high-level 
languages for data analytics (e.g., Hive, Pig, Sawzall, Scope) do not fully cover this domain. One key missing ingredient is the means to 
efficiently support iteration over the data. Zaharia et al., were the first to answer this call from a systems perspective with Spark. 
Spark adds the notion of a working set to data-parallel workflows and has published speed-ups of 30x over Hadoop MapReduce for many machine learning and graph algorithms.

Unfortunately, Spark does cover the whole pipeline of Big Data analytics; at Yahoo!, it is common to compose Pig, MPI and direct MapReduce program modules into workflows. 
This fractioning of individual processing steps can be a major pain e.g., for optimization, debugging, and code readability. Our prescription to this dilemma is a new DSL 
for data analytics called ScalOps. Like Pig, ScalOps combines the declarative style of SQL and the low-level procedural style of MapReduce. Like Spark, ScalOps can optimize 
its runtime¡ªthe Hyracks parallel-database engine¡ªfor repeated access to data collections. ScalOps is part of a broader research agenda to explore new abstractions
 for machine learning and graph-based analytics. In this talk, I will present example workflows from the machine learning domain expressed in ScalOps and their translation to Hyracks recursive query plans.

					In most practical systems, resources are either constrained or mutually exclusive. Constraints arise from network bandwidth restrictions, I/O and disk usage from writing images, 
					and CPU usage needed to extract features from the images. Detecting events in real time requires dynamically choosing a subset of the available sensors for processing at any given time. 
Furthermore, certain camera configurations are not feasible. For example, a camera cannot zoom into two different regions in its field of view.
Zooming into a specific area in the field of view of a camera would generate a high resolution image of the region in the expense of a wider field of view. 
Thus, the field of view needs to be changed dynamically to get a higher resolution images of certain regions of the space at the expanse other regions. 
In order to illustrate the complexity of this problem, consider a face recognition application, which is only interested in high resolution (by means of optical zoom) 
facial images. If we always zoom into a region to look for a high res face, we might miss presence of a person in different region and hence opportunity for zooming later to get the face in next time step.
In this talk we examine the problem of scheduling sensors for data collection and actuating them on real time to maximize some user-specified objective - e.g., 
detecting as much motion as possible or collect as many high resolution facial images. 
The main idea behind our approach is the use of sensor semantics to guide the scheduling process. We learn a dynamic probabilistic model of motion correlations 
between cameras, and use the model to guide resource allocation for our sensor network.
Although previous work has leveraged probabilistic models for sensor-scheduling, our work is distinct in its focus on real-time building-monitoring using a camera network.  
We validate our approach using a sensor network of a dozen cameras spread throughout a university building, recording measurements of unscripted human activity over a two week period. 
We automatically learn a semantic model of typical behaviors, and show that one can significantly improve efficiency of resource allocation and actuation by exploiting this model.

In this talk I will describe a new approach to datacenter storage called RAMCloud, where information is kept entirely in DRAM and large-scale systems are created by aggregating the main memories of thousands of commodity servers.  A RAMCloud can provide durable and available storage with 100-1000x the throughput of disk-based systems and 100-1000x lower access latency.  By combining low latency and large scale, RAMClouds will enable a new class of applications that manipulate large datasets more intensively than has ever been possible.

WatsonTitleAlgebraic Comprehensions (Database Optimization for Web 2.0 Queries)AbstractDirect support for querying is becoming a "must have" for programming languages targeting Web 2.0 and Cloud development. Most of those languages (Microsoft's Linq, University of Edinburgh's Links, EPFL's Scala, Yahoo!'s Pig Latin, IBM's Thorn, etc) rely on the classic notion of comprehensions over collections. At the language level, comprehensions are a perfect choice, being well understood programming constructs, and capturing the expressive power of SQL iterators. At the compiler level, however, they are at odds with database optimizers which mostly rely on relational (or nested-relational) algebras. That mismatch was clearly on display during the design of XQuery, whose semantics is based on comprehensions, and for which most implementations target relational backends. We propose a alternative functional semantic formulation of XQuery to the one proposed by W3C, which is also based on comprehensions but has the benefit of corresponding precisely to compilation into a typed algebra that supports traditional database optimizations. First, this provides a formal foundation for XQuery implementations that want to ensure semantics integrity with the standard, along with modern database optimization techniques. Also, it provides key insights into the nature of database compilers that we believe is essential for the integration of database and programming languages technology. We notably discover that type systems for database algebras require an original solution to the old problem of subtyping with record concatenation, and that such a type system can eliminate the need for complex side conditions used in query language optimization.

            	As with several prior efforts, RubySky scripts execute either in a local environment or in the cloud (Hadoop). 
            	Typically, cloud-based execution is highly opaque and hands-off, rendering debugging and iterative code development 
            	very difficult. RubySky, on the other hand, aims for a more transparent and adjustable paradigm.  
            	It includes the ability to ``peek into'' intermediate cloud execution pathways, integrated as a first-class language construct.  
            	Also integrated into the language is a way for the user to make last-minute code revisions, at any point at which troublesome
            	 data is encountered in the cloud. 
            	 Combined, these features aim to improve usability for users who develop and run single-use scripts that

share large data collections, exploiting communication proximity and
selectively replicating content is essential.  Cimbiosys is a replicated
storage platform that permits each device to define its own content-based
filtering criteria and to exchange data directly with other devices.  This
talk focuses on the key challenge of ensuring eventual consistency in the
face of fluid network connectivity, redefinable content filters, and
arbitrary updates.  Notably, Cimbiosys guarantees that each device
eventually stores precisely those items whose latest version matches its
custom filter and represents its replication-specific metadata in a compact
form, resulting in low data synchronization overhead.  This permits ad hoc
replication between newly encountered devices and frequent synchronization
between established partners, even over low bandwidth wireless networks or
across geo-distributed data centers.  (This talk will be a Ted and Janice Smith
Distinguished lecture, and not at the normal time or place for ISG Seminars.)

Mar 25, 2011 SPEAKER: Alexander Behm, UCI PhD studentAnswering Approximate String Queries on Large Data Sets Using External MemoryDetailsDate and TimeMar 25, 2011  2pmLocationDBH 3011SpeakerAlexander Behm, UCI PhD studentTitleAnswering Approximate String Queries on Large Data Sets Using External MemoryAbstractAn approximate string query is to find from a
collection of strings those that are similar to a given query string.
Answering such queries is important in many applications such
as data cleaning and record linkage, where errors could occur
in queries as well as the data. Many existing algorithms have
focused on in-memory indexes. In this paper we investigate how
to efficiently answer such queries in a disk-based setting, by
systematically studying the effects of storing data and indexes
on disk. We devise a novel physical layout for an inverted
index to answer queries and we study how to construct it with
limited buffer space. To answer queries, we develop a cost-based,
adaptive algorithm that balances the I/O costs of retrieving
candidate matches and accessing inverted lists. Experiments
on large, real datasets verify that simply adapting existing
algorithms to a disk-based setting does not work well and that our
new techniques answer queries efficiently. Further, our solutions
significantly outperform a recent tree-based index, BED-tree.
This talk is a ICDE practice talk.
            Mar 18, 2011 SPEAKER: Pinaki SinhaSummarization of  Personal Photo CollectionsDetailsDate and TimeMar 18, 2011  2pmLocationDBH 3011SpeakerPinaki SinhaTitleSummarization of  Personal Photo CollectionsAbstractThe volume of personal photos hosted on photo archives and social sharing platforms 
            	has been increasing exponentially. According to recent estimates, 6 Billion photos are uploaded
            	 on Facebook per month. It is difficult to get an overview of a large collection of personal 
            	 photos without browsing though the entire database manually. In this talk, I will discuss a 
            	 framework to generate representative subset summaries from photo collections present on personal 
            	 archives or social networks. I will define salient properties of an effective photo summary 
            	 and model summarization as an optimization of these properties, given the size constraints. 
            	 Computer vision, and IR  based techniques will be used to generate summaries that "look good" as well as 
            	 are informative. I will also introduce information theory based metrics for evaluating photo 
            	 summaries based on their information content and the ability to satisfy user's information needs. 
            	 I will also discuss the manual evaluation experiments that were done to evaluate summaries.

in classification to find a subspace that maximally separates
class patterns according to the Fisher Criterion.   It was
previously proven that a pre-whitening step can be used to
truly optimize the Fisher Criterion. In this talk, we show that
more insight and more applications may be derived from this
classical technique.

First, we explore the subspaces induced by this whitened FLD.
In particular, we show how the Identity Space and Variation
Space are useful for decomposing and representing data.
We give sufficient conditions for these spaces to exist.  Through
experiments we also show how these spaces may
be used for classification and image synthesis.

Second, we further extend classical Fisher to handle data exhibiting
multiple factors (modes), e.g. face images that exhibit personal
identity, illumination, and pose.  We call our method Multimodal
Discriminant Analysis (MMDA), which is useful for decomposing
a dataset into independent modes. For face images, MMDA
effectively separates identity, illumination and pose into mutually
orthogonal subspaces.  MMDA is based on maximizing the
Fisher Criterion on all modes simultaneously, and is therefore
well-suited for multimodal and mode-invariant pattern recognition.
We also show that MMDA may be used for dimension reduction,
and for synthesizing face images under novel illumination, and
even novel personal identity.Speaker BioTerence Sim is an Asst. Prof. at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore.  He teaches an undergraduate course in computer vision, as well as a graduate course in multimedia fundamentals.  For research, he works primarily in these areas:  face recognition, biometrics, and computational photography.   He is also interested in computer vision problems in general, such as shape-from-shading, photometric stereo, object recognition.  On the side, he dabbles with some aspects of music processing, such as polyphonic music transcription.  Dr. Sim serves as Vice-Chairman of the Biometrics Technical Committee (BTC), Singapore, and Chairman of the Cross-Jurisdictional and Societal Aspects Working Group (WG6) within the BTC.  The interesting issues here are the legal and privacy aspects of using biometrics.   He also serves as Vice-President of the Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence Association (PREMIA), a national professional body for pattern recognition.  Dr. Sim obtained his PhD from Carnegie Mellon in 2002, his MSc from Stanford University in 1991, and his SB from MIT in 1990.Feb 16, 2011SPEAKER:  Laura Haas (IBM)New Principles for Information Integration DetailsDate and TimeFeb 16, 2011 11amLocationDBH 4011Speaker Laura Haas (IBM)TitleNew Principles for Information Integration Abstract Ten years ago, Clio introduced nonprocedural schema mappings to describe the relationship between data in heterogeneous schemas. This enabled powerful tools for mapping discovery and integration code generation, greatly simplifying the integration process.  However, further progress is needed. We see an opportunity to raise the level of abstraction further, and propose two new principles that the next generation of integration systems should embody. Holistic information integration supports iteration across the various integration tasks, leveraging information about both schema and data to improve the integrated result. Integration independence allows applications to be independent of how, when, and where information integration takes place, making materialization and the timing of transformations an optimization decision that is transparent to applications. This talk introduces these principles and describes some promising recent work in these directions. Speaker Bio Laura Haas is an IBM Fellow and has been director of computer science at IBM Almaden Research Center since 2005.  Previously, Dr. Haas was responsible for Information Integration Solutions (IIS) architecture in IBM's Software Group after leading the IIS development team through its first two years.  She joined the development team in 2001 as manager of DB2 UDB Query Compiler development.  Before that, Dr. Haas was a research staff member and manager at the Almaden lab for nearly twenty years.   In IBM Research, she worked on and managed a number of exploratory projects in distributed database systems.  Dr. Haas is best known for her work on the Starburst query processor (from which DB2 UDB was developed); on Garlic, a system which allowed federation of heterogeneous data sources; and on Clio, the first semi-automatic tool for heterogeneous schema mapping.  Garlic technology, married with DB2 UDB query processing, is the basis for the IBM WebSphere Information Server's federation capabilities, while Clio capabilities are a core differentiator in IBM¡¯s Rational Data Architect.  Dr. Haas has received several IBM awards for Outstanding Technical Achievement and Outstanding Innovation, and an IBM Corporate Award for her work on federated database technology. In 2010 she was recognized with the Anita Borg Institute Technical Leadership Award. She is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the IBM Academy of Technology, an ACM Fellow, and Vice Chair of the board of the Computing Research Association.  Dr. Haas received her PhD from the University of Texas at Austin, and her bachelor degree from Harvard University.Feb 4, 2011 (POSTPONED)SPEAKER:  Amy VoidaHomebrew DatabasesDetailsDate and TimeFeb 4, 2011 (POSTPONED) 2pmLocationDBH 3011Speaker Amy VoidaTitleHomebrew Databases For more information on CS distinguished lectures, please visit Computer Science Department Seminar Series.^ topLast Updated on January 07, 2011

qSpell: Spelling Correction of Web Search Queries						
					
				
				
					
								
							
											
									Analysis of Web search query logs shows that roughly 10-15% of
									queries sent to search engines contain spelling errors. A query
									speller is crucial to search engines in improving Web search
									relevance, because it is hard for a search engine to retrieve relevant
									contents with misspelled keywords. In this project we explore
									leveraging Web-scale data for implementing a highly accurate and
									efficient spell checker. To implement a Web-scale spell checker that
									can handle diverse needs of Web users, we process massive amounts of
									data such as query logs and Web ngrams to build accurate language
									models. (PDF)

								Name:JDB2011 
										[Download]Size:11,134 queriesLast update:June 20, 2011Description:
											We have randomly sampled 11,134 queries from
											the publicly available AOL and 2009 Million Query Track
											query sets and asked 8 human assessors to provide spelling
											corrections for these queries. Each query was judged by at
											least one human assessor and queries for which the human
											assessors had provided at least one suggestion which was
											different from the original query were reviewed by at least
											another human assessor. In order to assist the human assessors
											in providing the most plausible suggestions for each
											query, we had designed an interface that was showing Google
											and Bing search results for each query.
										Format:
											The queries of this data set are split into 6,000 queries that can be
											used for trainig and cross-fold validation. The final models should be
											evaluated on the three test splits (each 1711 queries) and average
											performance across these three splits should be reported.
											Each line has the following format:
											query <tab> suggestion1 <tab> suggestion2 <tab> ...

We will cover the entity relationship (E/R) approach to database design. We will cover the relational data model, mapping E/R designs to relations, relational design theory, abstract query language such as relational algebra, and programming in SQL. Students will get exposure to how relational database management systems are used to implement a database. Time permitting, we will also consider advanced database management features such as object-oriented and object-relational database systems. This course is aimed at database design and use of database management systems in implementing database applications.CS122B: Projects in Database Management and Web ApplicationsFall 2011 / Spring 2012 - Prof. LiThis course exposes students to advanced programming concepts and
provides students with a greater focus on using DBMS techniques to
build Web-based applications. It is intended for two purposes: (1) It
introduces students to the modern data management techniques including
database connectivity, Web application development, extending database
functions, database administration, and XML. (2) It teaches students
how to use these technologies to build real-world applications. The
course builds on  CS122A, which introduces students to the classical
relational databases and SQL programming.
		CS143: Principles of Operating SystemsSpring 2011 - Nalini VenkatasubramanianThis course covers principles and concepts of process and resource management, especially as seen in operating systems. Processes, memory management, protection, scheduling, file systems, and I/O systems.CS190: ENTREPRENEURSHIPWinter 2011 - Prof. JainTBD^ topGraduate CoursesCS212: Multimedia Systems and ApplicationsWinter 2011 - Prof. JainThis course will discuss elements of multimedia systems. Multimedia is becoming the common mode of synchronous, asynchronous, local, and remote communication. Most of the current assisted communication technologies use single medium. Adoption of multimedia has significant social implications. More relevant to this course, it has significant opportunity for technology development.

Multimedia computing and communication systems started receiving attention more than a decade ago. Naturally, early systems dealt with very limited aspect of multimedia. With progress in technology, we will have to address several computing and communication issues in dealing with creation, communication, storage, access, and presentation of multimedia. In this course, we will discuss fundamentals of multimedia systems and address emerging issues that are being addressed as well as should be addressed. In discussing topics, our emphasis will be on concepts and fundamentals.CS222: Principles of Database ManagementFall 2011 - Prof. CareyThis course provides an implementor's view of database management systems. It covers fundamental principles and implementation techniques, issues, and trade-offs related to database management systems. Topics covered include storage management, buffer management, record-oriented file systems, access methods, query optimization, and query processing,. This course is a must for those students wishing to explore database management as an area of research and/or who plan on taking CS223 or CS224. A significant portion of database systems research as well as industrial database and information system development deals with adapting the basic database techniques covered in this course to new advances in hardware and software technologies or to the requirements of different applications and data types.CS223: Transaction Processing and Distributed Data ManagementWinter 2011 -  Prof. MehrotraThe course covers fundamental principles underlying transaction processing including database consistency, concurrency control, database recovery and fault-tolerance. The course includes transaction processing in centralized, distributed, parallel, and client-server environments. It also covers distributed database systems. The course is a prerequisite for further advanced data management courses and research principles of data management.CS224: Advances in Database Management System Technology Spring 2011 - Prof. MehrotraThis course covers selected topics in advanced database research. Its content differs in each offering. This quarter we will focus on Web search. We will present recent papers in the literature. Students will do a substantial project. CS230: Distributed Computer SystemWinter 2011 - Prof. VenkatasubramanianPrinciples of distributed computing systems. Topics covered include message-passing, remote procedure calls, distributed shared memory synchronization, resource and process/thread management, distributed file systems, naming and security. Prerequisite: consent of instructor. CS237: Distributed Systems MiddlewareSpring 2011 - Prof. VenkatasubramanianThis course discusses concepts, techniques and issues in developing distributed systems middleware that provides high performance in large scale distributed and networked environments. Issues in ensuring the satisfaction of QoS  requirements for multimedia applications via middleware environments will also be discussed. The course will cover existing middleware standards and solutions such as DCE, CORBA, DCOM,.NET,EJB,J2EE, XML and discuss their relative advantages and shortcomings.CS295: Data-Intensive Computing ProjectsFall 2011 -  Prof. Careyn this course, students will review the current state of the art in data-intensive computing and then focus on doing a project of their choosing
    	 related to the field. The course will begin with some initial all-hands reading, lectures, and perhaps exercises involving MapReduce and Hadoop as well
    	  as UCI's own ASTERIX software. Students will then spend the bulk of the course taking a much deeper dive into some particular aspect of data-intensive
    	   computing that interests them. Students from fields like machine learning or social science may wish to explore the application of data-intensive 
    	   computing techniques to problems in their area; students interested in programming languages may choose to compare (hands-on!) several alternative 
    	   data-intensive languages and/or platforms; students interested in data management techniques may wish to benchmark new storage technologies 
    	   (e.g., some of the emerging "NoSQL stores") or to spend the quarter working as an extension of the ASTERIX development team by adding new types 
    	   and functions, operators, and/or storage features to the ASTERIX/Hyracks platform under development at UCI.CS295: Information Quality and Entity resolutionFall 2010 - Prof. KalashnikovThe effectiveness of data-driven technologies as decision support tools, data exploration and scientific discovery tools is closely tied to the
quality of data on which such techniques are applied. It is well recognized that the outcome of the analysis is only as good as the quality of data on which the analysis is performed. That is why today organizations spend a tangible percent of their budgets on cleaning tasks such as removing duplicates, correcting errors, filling missing values, to improve data quality prior to pushing data through the analysis pipeline. The objective of this course is to deepen our understanding of recent trends in data quality research. The course focuses specifically, but not exclusively, on data management techniques for solving Entity Resolution (ER) problem. The ER challenge arises because objects in the real world are referred to using references or descriptions that are not always unique identifiers of the objects, leading to ambiguity. This ambiguity must be resolved, or taken into account, when analyzing the data to produce meaningful results. The course is based on student presentations of prominent recent publications in the area of information quality.CS295: Middleware for Mobile and Pervasive ComputingTBDCS295: ENTREPRENEURSHIPWinter 2011 - Prof. JainTBD^ topLast Updated on January 07, 2011

  Friends of the Donald Bren School





As public funding for our state's universities declines and the
                costs and risks of corporate R&D escalate, there is increasing
                motivation for forging bonds between academia and industry.
The Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences is research oriented -- even at the undergraduate level -- with
                formal projects addressing hardware, software, algorithm design,
                artificial intelligence and the societal impacts of computing. 
Research-orientated education means ICS students arrive at 
                companies already comfortable on the leading edge and poised to make
                an immediate
                impact.
In addition to students, our world-renowed faculty work with outside
            companies and frequently collaborate with professionals in
            other academic
            areas
            to create
            even greater synergy. 
This results in a combination of corporate
            insight, faculty guidance and student energy that has proven time
            and again to be the spark that ignites tomorrow¡¯s products
          and services.
The ICS programs listed below offer you an opportunity to interface with our students and faculty.

Butterworth Product Development CompetitionThis competition offers an opportunity for students to develop their business skills and earn cash prizes.?Learn more??
Tech JobsWhether you are looking for computer science interns, part-time or full-time employees, Tech Jobs is the place for you. Post your job opening and know that you are reaching ICS students and alumni each and every time!?Learn more???
Scholarships & FellowshipsSupport a student by sponsoring a scholarship or fellowship. In forging relationships with the students they support, current donors have discovered that ICS students are more than scholars, they also are community volunteers, dedicated youth leaders, responsible young adults and promising future professionals.?Learn more??

Undergraduate Student Policies




Laptop Requirement and Computer Use
Beginning in Fall 2014, students enrolling in ICS 31/CSE 41, ICS 32/CSE 42, and ICS 33/CSE 43 are required to own a personal
laptop for coursework. 
? If You're Planning to Get a New Laptop
Students receiving financial aid in the fall can request an additional
one-time budget increase of up to $2,000 for a new computer. The additional
funding available is limited to student and/or parent loans, depending on
eligibility and borrowing limits. This
allowance covers hardware, software, monitor, printer, and extended warranty.
Students
are encouraged to visit or contact the Office of Financial Aid and
Scholarships, 102 Aldrich Hall, by email at finaid@uci.edu, or phone at (949)
824-8262, for details on the budget increase process and limitations.
? Recommended Computer Specifications
RAM: 4 GB or higherHard drive: 250 GB or more Processor: Intel Core i5 or i7, or similar AMDWeight: Students are expected to bring their laptops to
class so please consider weight if this is a factor for you.Screen: When writing/debugging programs, more screen
space tends to be very useful.Warranty: Extended hardware warranty is recommended.

*If you have a laptop that was purchased within the last 4
years, the system should be adequate for lower division work. Your computer should be running an operating
system which will receive security updates and should be minimum 2 GB of RAM
and have sufficient hard drive space to install required programs. 
**Recommended, but not required:
Laptop cable and lockExternal monitor, keyboard and mouseUSB drive or external hard drive for data back-upsSmall black & white laser printer (Printers for use are
available throughout campus; nominal fee to print)

Undergraduate Student Policies




Withdrawal and Readmission
Students who are planning to withdraw from the University are encouraged to seek advice from an academic
counselor to discuss the withdrawal and readmission
process.
?

?
? Withdrawing from UCI
If the decision to withdraw is made after tuition and fees
for an academic quarter are paid, a Withdrawal form is required. The form can be picked up in any academic advising office (including the ICS Student Affairs Office), as well as from the Registrar's Office. Bren Students must obtain the signature of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs before submitting the form to the Registrar's Office for processing.? Please note that an ICS academic counselor may sign on the Associate Dean for Student Affairs' behalf.
Information on the schedule of refunds can be found on the University Registrar website.
If the decision to withdraw is made before tuitions and fees for the next quarter are paid, a formal notice of withdrawal or withdrawal form is not
necessary, although recommended.
?
? Readmitting to UCI

Readmission to UCI and the Bren School of ICS is NOT
automatic.? There are different policies and processes for readmission based on the student's reasons for and time of withdrawal.
If a student is seeking to readmit after voluntary withdrawal from UCI while in good standing, readmission will be granted if the student re-enrolls within one year. After more than one year, it will be considred on a case by case basis. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs will make the decision to readmit a student based on additional documentation, including the following:
number of completed units while at UCInumber of units remaining for completion of general
education and degree requirementsgrades for coursework taken at other institutions or through ACCESS UCIdemonstrated readiness for the academic challenge of UCI coursework.
All materials required for readmission petition must be
submitted as a complete package. An academic counselor will attach a summary of
previous course work and/or contract conditions for the Associate Dean¡¯s
consideration.
There are additional readmission requirements if a student withdrew while on academic probation or after academic disqualification:
For Readmission After Voluntary Withdrawal from UCI While on
Academic Probation
For Readmission After Academic Disqualification
?
? Other Readmission Info
Students must meet with an ICS academic counselor well in advance of the
 quarter in which the student plans on readmitting. Readmission 
applications are processed by ICS academic counselors.
For information about fees, procedures and deadlines, visit the Registrar¡¯s website on readmission.
Note that only UC-transferable courses will be considered when determining
a student's eligibility for readmission to one of the Bren School majors.

A readmitted student who has not been enrolled at UCI for
three or more consecutive quarters must adhere to the graduation 
requirements in effect for the quarter in which the student is 
readmitted, OR those
subsequently established.

        	Overview
            Welcome to the new home of the AsterixDB Big Data Management
            System (BDMS). The AsterixDB BDMS is the result of about 3.5 years
            of R&D involving researchers at UC Irvine, UC Riverside, and UC San
            Diego. The AsterixDB code base now consists of roughly 250K lines
            of Java code that has been co-developed at UC Irvine and UC
            Riverside.
            
            Initiated in 2009, the NSF-sponsored ASTERIX project has been
            developing new technologies for ingesting, storing, managing,
            indexing, querying, and analyzing vast quantities of
            semi-structured information. The project has been combining ideas
            from three distinct areas¡ªsemi-structured data, parallel databases,
            and data-intensive computing (a.k.a. today¡¯s Big Data platforms)¡ªin
            order to create a next-generation, open-source software platform
            that scales by running on large, shared-nothing commodity computing
            clusters.

            The ASTERIX effort has been targeting a wide range of
            semi-structured information, ranging from ¡°data¡± use cases¡ªwhere
            information is well-typed and highly regular¡ªto ¡°content¡± use
            cases¡ªwhere data tends to be irregular, much of each datum may be
            textual, and the ultimate schema for the various data types
            involved may be hard to anticipate up front. The ASTERIX project
            has been addressing technical issues including highly scalable data
            storage and indexing, semi-structured query processing on very
            large clusters, and merging time-tested parallel database
            techniques with modern data-intensive computing techniques to
            support performant yet declarative solutions to the problem of
            storing and analyzing semi-structured information effectively.
            
            The first fruits of this labor have been captured in the
            AsterixDB system that is now being released in preliminary or
            ¡°Beta¡± release form. We are hoping that the arrival of AsterixDB
            will mark the beginning of the ¡°BDMS era¡±, and we hope that both
            the Big Data community and the database community will find the
            AsterixDB system to be interesting and useful for a much broader
            class of problems than can be addressed with any one of today¡¯s
            current Big Data platforms and related technologies (e.g., Hadoop,
            Pig, Hive, HBase, MongoDB, and so on). One of our project mottos
            has been ¡°one size fits a bunch¡±¡ªat least that has been our

What Is AsterixDB?Getting and Using AsterixDB

What Is AsterixDB? [Back to TOC]
In a nutshell, AsterixDB is a full-function BDMS (Big Data Management System) with a rich feature set that distinguishes it from pretty much any other Big Data platform that¡¯s out and available today. We believe that its feature set makes it well-suited to modern needs such as web data warehousing and social data storage and analysis. AsterixDB has:

A semistructured NoSQL style data model (ADM) resulting from extending JSON with object database ideasAn expressive and declarative query language (AQL) that supports a broad range of queries and analysis over semistructured dataA parallel runtime query execution engine, Hyracks, that has been scale-tested on up to 1000+ cores and 500+ disksPartitioned LSM-based data storage and indexing to support efficient ingestion and management of semistructured dataSupport for query access to externally stored data (e.g., data in HDFS) as well as to data stored natively by AsterixDBA rich set of primitive data types, including spatial and temporal data in addition to integer, floating point, and textual dataSecondary indexing options that include B+ trees, R trees, and inverted keyword (exact and fuzzy) index typesSupport for fuzzy and spatial queries as well as for more traditional parametric queriesBasic transactional (concurrency and recovery) capabilities akin to those of a NoSQL store

Getting and Using AsterixDB [Back to TOC]
You are most likely here because you are interested in getting your hands on AsterixDB¡ªso you would like to know how to get it, how to set it up, and how to use it. The following is a list of the supporting documents that we have available today:


Installing AsterixDB using Managix : This is our installation guide, and it is where you should start. This document will tell you how to obtain, install, and manage instances of AsterixDB, including both single-machine setup (for developers) as well as cluster installations (for deployment in its intended form).
AsterixDB 101: An ADM and AQL Primer : This is a first-timers introduction to the user model of the AsterixDB BDMS, by which we mean the view of AsterixDB as seen from the perspective of an ¡°average user¡± or Big Data application developer. The AsterixDB user model consists of its data modeling features (ADM) and its query capabilities (AQL). This document presents a tiny ¡°social data warehousing¡± example and uses it as a backdrop for describing, by example, the key features of AsterixDB. By working through this document, you will learn how to define the artifacts needed to manage data in AsterixDB, how to load data into the system, how to use most of the basic features of its query language, and how to insert and delete data dynamically.
Asterix Data Model (ADM), Asterix Functions, Asterix functions for Allen¡¯s Relations, and Asterix Query Language (AQL) : These are reference documents that catalog the primitive data types and built-in functions available in AQL and the reference manual for AQL itself.
REST API to AsterixDB : Access to data in an AsterixDB instance is provided via a REST-based API. This is a short document that describes the REST API entry points and their URL syntax.
To all who have now come this far: Thanks for your interest in AsterixDB, and for kicking its tires in its Beta form. In addition to getting the system and trying it out, please sign up as a member of the AsterixDB user mailing list (asterixdb-users (at) googlegroups.com) so that you can contact us easily with your questions, issues, and other feedback. We want AsterixDB to be a ¡°big hit¡± some day, and we are anxious to see what users do with it and to learn from that feedback what we should be working on most urgently in the next phase of the project.

		The Information Systems Group (ISG) at UC Irvine is part of the Department of Computer Science  within the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences.
		 
		ISG is a broad and vital group consisting of five UCI CS faculty members (Profs. Carey, Jain, Li, Mehrotra, and Venkatasubramanian), adjunct faculty member (Prof. Kalashnikov), students, visitors, project staff, and other affiliates.
		The mission of ISG is broad-ranging, as the combination of the next-generation Web, diverse forms of multimodal data, and new devices have created a world rich with heterogeneous forms of information that need to be located, accessed, queried, managed, archived, and integrated much like the more traditional (yet ever important) enterprise data of yesteryear.
		ISG's mission is to address this rapidly evolving information infrastructure by conducting research on all aspects of modern data and information systems. 
		ISG faculty interests range from theory to systems, from principles to practice, and from design and experimentation to deployment and applications.
		Application focus areas include emergency response, situational awareness, and cyber-physical systems.
		Research topics with ISG cover architectures, algorithms, and performance evaluation of a variety of next-generation information systems and techologies.
		Current topics include database systems, data analysis and data cleansing, data warehousing systems, information integration tools, multimedia information systems and search, semantic Web, adaptive middleware, experiential computing, peer-to-peer systems, mobile and pervasive computing, service-oriented architectures, search techniques, scalable data-intensive computing, and data sharing and dissemination.
		Current projects within ISG are exploring challenges in the realization of such systems stemming from information diversity and heterogeneity (e.g., multidimensional data, XML, text, multimedia data, and sensor streams) and due to emerging application needs (including privacy and security, mobility, quality of data, quality of service, and reliability and robustness in extreme situations).
		M.S./Ph.D. Studies in Information Systems at UC Irvine The faculty of the Information Systems Group (ISG) at UC Irvine is looking for a handful of excellent prospective students who are seeking an exciting, active place to study and do research on databases and information systems starting each Fall. 
		Several large projects are underway and several new ones are just beginning and will provide excellent opportunities for incoming students to "get in on the ground floor" of interesting new research initiatives.
		ISG is a part of the CS Department within the Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences at UC Irvine, an environment that offers a number of unique advantages and opportunities.  Being one of just a handful of such schools across the country, ICS offers a broad, stimulating intellectual environment for graduate studies.  ICS is comprised of three departments - Computer Science, Informatics, and Statistics - covering all traditional computer science areas as well as related areas such as software engineering, human-computer interaction and usability, collaboration technologies, and statistical machine learning and data mining and analysis.
		
		UC Irvine itself, in the words of our current chancellor, "combines the strengths of a major research university with the bounty of an incomparable Southern California location."  Thus, in addition to a stimulating research and educational environment, graduate study in ISG at UC Irvine offers attractive off-hours opportunities.  Our location in  Orange County  offers easy access to a wide variety of outdoor and indoor entertainment and sporting activities.
		
		More information about graduate study in CS at UC Irvine can be found on the CS Department's graduate studies page.  Applications for admission for a given Fall are due by January 15th of that calendar year.  More specifics about ISG, its faculty, and its projects can be found on our new ISG web site.

    VISITING ISG
        The UCI Information Systems Group is located on the 2nd and 3rd floors of Donald Bren Hall (DBH).
        If you are coming by car, the simplest place to park is the nearby Anteater Parking Structure (APS).
        APS is an indoor/outdoor parking structure with a manned guard booth that sells visitor permits,
        and it is just a short, 3-4 minute southwesterly walk from APS to our offices in Donald Bren Hall.
        Landmark-wise, DBH is right next door to the University Club, which you will likely see signs for.
        (If you are walking to DBH from APS and reach the University Club, you've gone one building too far.)
        If you are traveling to UCI by cab, the University Club is the drop-off/pick-up point to shoot for.
        Excellent directional info and local/campus maps can be found at here.
        More UCI visitor information can be found at http://www.ics.uci.edu/about/visit/index.php as well
        as http://uci.edu/campusmap/.

    We are providing an interactive search widget that can be
      embedded into the International Committee of the Red Cross
      FamilyLinks website. The widget allows for interactive and error
      tolerant searches over the Red Cross FamilyLinks data.

    The widget is designed for
      the Haiti
      - Earthquake 2010 - List page. Integration can be very
      easily done with by replacing the current Input search box with
      the following HTML code:

      
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
    href="http://fr.ics.uci.edu/widgets/redcross/isearch.css">
<input type="text" id="input" autocomplete="off" size=80>
<script type="text/javascript"
    src="http://fr.ics.uci.edu/widgets/redcross/isearch.js">
</script>

    Bellow is a screen-shot of how the page will look after the
      integration:

Information and Computer Science Degree




The UCI General Catalogue
 is the official guide to all degree and graduation requirements; the 
information below is intended for general planning purposes only. For previous calendar years, please see here.


Concentration in Informatics-General Track (INF-GEN), (M.S. and Ph.D.)


In addition to the Informatics-General concentration, there are also two other Informatics concentrations listed below. Click on a track to
 learn more about it.
Interactive
 & Collaborative TechnologyUbiquitous
 Computing
The general track of the Informatics concentration covers aspects 
from both the ICT track and the to broadly cover the 
topics of Informatics. 
CURRENT DEGREE REQUIREMENTS
Informatics is the interdisciplinary study of the design, 
application, use, and impact of information technology. It goes beyond 
technical design to focus on the relationship between information system
 design and use in real-world settings.
These investigations lead to new forms of system architecture, new 
approaches to system design and development, new means of information 
system implementation and deployment, and new models of interaction 
between technology and social, cultural, and organizational settings.
In the Bren School, Informatics is concerned with software 
architecture, software development, design and analysis, programming 
languages, ubiquitous computing, information retrieval and management, 
human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and 
other topics that lie at the relationship between information technology
 design and use in social and organizational settings. 
Effective design requires an ability to analyze things from many 
different perspectives, including computer science, information science,
 organizational science, social science, and cognitive science. 
Relevant courses in those disciplines are therefore an integral part 
of the program and give this concentration a unique interdisciplinary 
flavor, which is imperative as the computing and information technology 
fields play such a pervasive role in our daily lives.

Undergraduate Student Policies




Academic Standing
Students' academic status is reviewed on a quarterly basis. Academic standing is determined by GPA and degree progress. To stay in good standing:
Maintain a quarterly and cumulative GPA above 2.0, andMake progress towards your chosen degree
The Student Affairs Office will notify the student of their academic probation status via their UCI email account.? The letter will include an academic probation contract.? The contract will outline specific conditions that must be met in order to return to good academic standing.
It is the student¡¯s responsibility to:
manage their UCI accountto read and respond to official messages from their academic counselors in a timely manner.monitor academic progress and maintain good academic standing.
Failure to follow through on the steps outlined in your academic probation letter will result in an administrative hold on the student¡¯s record.
Student should contact their academic counselor soon after receiving the academic probation notification to ensure their upcoming course load is reasonable and to learn about helpful campus resources.
?

?
? Academic Probation
Students are subject to probation any time their quarterly or cumulative GPA falls below 2.0, or if they have violated one or more terms of the academic probation contract they are currently on.
**If a student¡¯s term or cumulative GPA falls below a 1.5, the student will be dismissed from the Donald Bren School of ICS effective immediately.? This policy applies to full-time and part-time students.

? Academic Probation Stages
Academic Probation 1
-AP 1 results if the student¡¯s term or cumulative GPA falls below a 2.0.
-Student will be placed on an academic probation contract for the following quarter.
Academic Probation 2 / Subject to Disqualification
-AP 2 results if the student is on two consecutive quarters of academic probation, or has not met one or more terms of the academic probation 1 contract.?
-Student is subject to disqualification
-Student is given the opportunity to appeal the possible / pending disqualification status
*Please note that being subject to disqualification is NOT the same as being formally disqualified

? Submitting a Letter of Appeal
A letter of appeal should explain any unusual or extenuating circumstances that contributed to the student's academic difficulties.? It must also detail the student's plans and actions for effectively addressing these circumstances (including the use of campus resources) so student can return to good academic standing.
The Associate Dean will carefully review the student's appeal letter, transcript and academic file with the academic counselors before making a decision. ?Note that the Associate Dean for Student Affairs is the chief academic officer for the Bren School of ICS, and his decisions regarding disqualification appeals are final.
If the appeal is granted, the student will be held to an academic contract that outlines the expectations and timeframe for returning to good academic standing.
If the appeal is denied, the student will be formally disqualified from the major, the Bren School of ICS, and UC Irvine. ?
*Instructions on how to appeal, including deadline and where to send the letter will be indicated in the student¡¯s academic probation letter.

? Disqualification
If a student is formally disqualified, he or she will be restricted from registering for courses or using university services after a stated date. The Registrar's Office will also be instructed to note the effective date of the disqualification on the student's official transcript.? An official letter will be sent to the student's permanent address on file.
It is recommended for the student to see an academic counselor to learn about the readmission process and policy.

? Readmission
If a student has been formally disqualified, the student is encouraged to make an appointment to speak with an academic counselor to learn about the readmission policy and to strategize future plans and goals. Please visit the page on Withdrawal and Readmission for additional information.
If / when the student readmits to ICS after having been academically disqualified, the student must for the first quarter of return earn a 2.0 term GPA and Cs or higher in each course.? Failure to meet these terms may result in academic probation or being subject to disqualification.

		Classes (Taught and Under Development)
		Undergraduate Course - CS122A: Introduction to Data Management  (taught in Winter Quarter 2009) 	
		 This course provides students with an introduction to the design of databases and the use of database management systems for applications. We will cover the entity relationship (E/R) approach to database design. We will cover the relational data model, mapping E/R designs to relations, relational design theory, abstract query language such as relational algebra, and programming in SQL. Students will get exposure to how relational database management systems are used to implement a database. Time permitting, we will also consider advanced database management features such as object-oriented and object-relational database systems. This course is aimed at database design and use of database management systems in implementing database applications.  

		
		Graduate Course - Mobile Computing Systems and Applications  (current under development)	
		 This course covers topics in mobile computing that are useful for implementation of mobile systems and development of mobile applications. The goal is to provide students an extensive overview of state-of-the-art technologies and ongoing work that allow mobile systems to support a wide spectrum of mobile applications. The material presented in this course are collected mainly from the research literature. This course is designed for graduate students with some knowledge in mobile and wireless networks and distributed systems. Students will carry out in-depth independent research projects of their own interests.

Computer Science Degree




The UCI General Catalogue 
is the official guide to all degree and graduation requirements; the information 
below is intended for general planning purposes only. For previous calendar years, please click here.


Computer Science (CS) (M.S. and Ph.D.)

The Computer Science degree is a broad and flexible program which offers 
students opportunities for graduate study in the full spectrum of intellectual 
activity in computer science.?
CURRENT DEGREE REQUIREMENTS
Additional Information

The set of core and elective courses chosen by a student must be 
approved by the student's research advisor before advancement to candidacy. 
Faculty associated with each research area will provide suggested curricula for 
that area to guide students in their selection of courses. These curricula will 
also help Ph.D. students to prepare for their candidacy examination (see below) 
which must be taken in a specific research area.

 
Similarly, students may not take and count undergraduate courses in areas where they have already moved into graduate-level coursework. (The purpose of these undergraduate elective options are to help students to remedy undergraduate background deficiencies).
Ph.D. Candidacy Exam
The objective of the candidacy exam is to demonstrate in-depth knowledge of 
an area of computer science and readiness to carry out independent research at 
the doctoral level in that area. The student must complete all course 
requirements and the research project prior to advancing to candidacy. 
All requirements for candidacy including the candidacy exam must be completed 
by the end of the third year (or, for students with a previous MS in computer science or a related field, by the end of the second year). If the student does not pass on the first trial, 
they will be allowed until the end of the first quarter of the next year to 
advance to candidacy. 
The candidacy committee will consist of five faculty members, the majority of 
whom must be members of the student¡¯s program, to administer the exam according 
to UCI Senate Policy. Please see the ICS Graduate Office for policies 
regarding the advancement committee membership. 
The student takes an oral exam, administered by the five-member committee, 
during which s/he is tested on knowledge relevant to the chosen area of 
specialization. Each area is defined by a set of topics and reading list, which 
are available in the documents below: 
Artificial

Syllabus (PDF) Theory Syllabus 
(PDF)
The field of computer science is concerned with the design, analysis and 
implementation of computer systems as well as the use of computation as it is 
applied to virtually every field of study and use in the everyday world.
Computer systems can range in scope from tiny embedded systems to the 
internet as a whole. Research in computer science involves mathematical 
analysis, empirical experimentation and the implementation of proto-type 
systems. 
Core research areas include artificial intelligence and machine learning, 
bio-informatics, computer architecture, embedded systems, graphics and visual 
computing, databases and information management, multimedia, networked and 
distributed systems, programming languages and compilers, security and 
cryptography, design and analysis of algorithms, scientific computing, and 
ubiquitous computing.

About the Bren gift




The Donald Bren School of Information and 
Computer Sciences was made possible by the generous $20 million gift from Orange 
County business leader and philanthropist Donald Bren, chairman of The Irvine 
Company.
Mr. Bren's gift equals the largest single gift ever to UC Irvine and has 
created the most endowed faculty positions at one time on any University of 
California campus.
In recognition of this transformational gift, the school, renowned worldwide 
for leading the innovation of new information and computing technologies and 
producing an educated work force to fuel the economic engine, was renamed the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences at UC Irvine.
In conjunction with the June 9, 2004, naming announcement, the school also broke ground on its new 
home, Donald Bren Hall; the first classes were held there in January 2007.
Competitively positioned among other top-ranked schools, this gift allows the 
school of information and computer sciences to continue in its upward trajectory 
of recruiting and retaining the best and the brightest students, faculty and 
researchers. 
The school of information and computer sciences has long been a program that 
combines vision and determination with wisdom. Those attributes, in concert with 
Mr. Bren¡¯s support, will continue to allow its students, alumni and faculty to 
impact the world.
Elevated to school status in December 2002, the nationally acclaimed school 
is the first independent computer science school within the UC system and one of 
the fastest-growing programs of its kind in the nation.
Please explore these special pages for details of the gift and an up-close 
look at the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences.?

Getting Started
Please refer to the Flamingo Getting Started Guide.

Introduction

This release (in C++) includes the source code of several
algorithms for approximate string matching developed at UC Irvine. It
includes algorithms for approximate selection queries, location-based approximate keyword search, 
selectivity
estimation for approximate selection queries, approximate queries on
mixed types, and others.  Although an implementation for approximate
joins is included, the focus of this release is on approximate
selection queries.

Here is a brief explanation of the terms used above:

Approximate String Search: Given a collection of strings and a single string,
how to find those strings in the collection that are "similar to" the
given string? 

This functionality is implemented by the modules
Common, 
FilterTree,
Listmerger, 
StringMap,
and
PartEnum.  
We recommend getting started with
the FilterTree module for this purpose.

Selectivity Estimation for Approximate String Search: Given
a collection of strings and a single string, how can we estimate the
number of strings that are "similar to" the given string?  This
functionality is implemented in the SEPIA module.

Approximate String Join: Given two collections of strings (possibly the same
collection), how to find those pairs of strings that are "similar to"
each other?

Location-Based Approximate Keyword Search: Given a collection of spatial objects with 
descriptive keywords, find those objects within a given spatial region 
that have a given set of keywords. 
In addition, the keywords don't need to match exactly, but approximately.

This functionality is implemented by the module:
LBAK-Tree
  

There are various string similarity functions, such as 
Levenshtein Distance (aka the Edit Distance),

Jaccard Similarity,
Cosine Similarity, and 
Dice
Similarity.  The following is a description of the modules
corresponding to the source directory structure:

Common: This module contains classes for supporting 
the following similarity functions / distance measures: 
Levenshtein Distance (aka Edit Distance), Jaccard Similarity, Cosine Similarity, Dice Similarity. It also
provides functionality for decomposing strings into grams.

FilterTree: This module provides functionality for approximate string search
using an inverted-list index. Furthermore, 
query performance can be improved by adding filters, i.e. partitioning the string collection into 
disjoint subsets according to some property (e.g. the length of the strings). 
The use of filters is facilitated by a hierarchical structure (the FilterTree), 
in which each level in the tree corresponds to one filter. 
We have implemented the length and charsum filter. This package contains three flavors of indexes: 
in-memory indexes compressed & uncompressed and a disk-based index.

ListMerger: Answering approximate string queries based on an inverted-list index 
requires finding elements that occur at least T times on the inverted lists belonging 
to the grams in the query string (T depends on the similarity metric and the similarity threshold). 
This problem is commonly referred to as the T-occurrence problem.
This module implements several algorithms for solving the T-occurrence problem
as described in "Efficient Merging and Filtering Algorithms for Approximate String Searches",
Chen Li, Jiaheng Lu and Yiming Lu, ICDE 2008.
In addition, we have implemented efficient algorithms for disk-based indexes.

MAT-Tree: MAT-tree is an indexing structure to support
queries on data with an approximate string predicate and a numeric
predicate.  A typical query is: "Find employee records whose name is
similar to Speilberg and whose age is close to 45."  The indexing
structure is proposed in the following paper: "Indexing Mixed Types
for Approximate Retrieval," Liang Jin, Nick Koudas, Chen Li, Anthony
K.H. Tung, VLDB 2005, Trondheim, Norway.

SEPIA: This technique solves the problem of estimating the
selectivity of an approximate string predicate.  It can answer
questions such as: "From a collection of strings, how many of them
have an edit distance within 3 to a given string?".  Such information
can be used in optimizing queries of approximate string matching.  The
technique was published in the paper: "Selectivity Estimation for Fuzzy
String Predicates in Large Data Sets," Liang Jin and Chen Li, VLDB
2005, Trondheim, Norway.

StringMap: This algorithm maps strings from the
edit-distance metric space to a high-dimensional Euclidean space, and
uses a multi-dimensional indexing structure to answer approximate
queries.  The algorithm is published in the paper: "Efficient Record
Linkage in Large Data Sets," by Liang Jin, Chen Li, and Sharad
Mehrotra, in 8th International Conference on Database Systems for
Advanced Applications (DASFAA) 2003, Kyoto, Japan.

PartEnum: This algorithm is published in the paper:
"Efficient Exact Set-Similarity Joins," Arvind Arasu, Venkatesh Ganti,
Raghav Kaushik, VLDB 2006.  We implemented the algorithm to
support approximate string matching queries, excluding approximate joins.

TopK: This package contains algorithms for efficient Top-K approximate string search.

LBAK-Tree: This module implements 
location-based approximate keyword search as described in 
"Supporting Location-Based Approximate Keyword Search", by Sattam Alsubaiee, Alexander Behm and Chen Li.
It enhances an R*-Tree with inverted indexes for approximate selection queries. It implements various 
algorithms for choosing R*-Tree nodes to place inverted indexes in.
The FilterTree module is used to provide the inverted indexes for approximate selection queries.


In addition, we have provided some commonly used functions in the
util directory.



Changes in Version 4.1 (compared to Version 4.0)

Added support for Damerau-Levenshtein distance (edit distance also allowing swapping of two adjacent characters).
Compilation/warning fixes for OSX submitted by Jim Apple from On Time Systems. Thanks a lot, Jim!
Fixed 64-bit issues in LBAK-Tree.

1. Introduction [Back to TOC]
This document is intended as a reference guide to the full syntax and semantics of the Asterix Query Language (AQL), the language for talking to AsterixDB. This guide covers both the data manipulation language (DML) aspects of AQL, including its support for queries and data modification, as well as its data definition language (DDL) aspects.  New AsterixDB users are encouraged to read and work through the (friendlier) guide ¡°AsterixDB 101: An ADM and AQL Primer¡± before attempting to make use of this document. In addition, readers are advised to read and understand the Asterix Data Model (ADM) reference guide since a basic understanding of ADM concepts is a prerequisite to understanding AQL.In what follows, we detail the features of the AQL language in a grammar-guided manner: We list and briefly explain each of the productions in the AQL grammar, offering examples for clarity in cases where doing so seems needed or helpful.

2. Expressions [Back to TOC]


Query ::= Expression

An AQL query can be any legal AQL expression.


Expression ::= ( OperatorExpr | IfThenElse | FLWOR | QuantifiedExpression )

AQL is a fully composable expression language. Each AQL expression returns zero or more Asterix Data Model (ADM) instances. There are four major kinds of expressions in AQL. At the topmost level, an AQL expression can be an OperatorExpr (similar to a mathematical expression), an IfThenElse (to choose between two alternative values), a FLWOR expression (the heart of AQL, pronounced ¡°flower expression¡±), or a QuantifiedExpression (which yields a boolean value). Each will be detailed as we explore the full AQL grammar.

Primary Expressions


PrimaryExpr ::= Literal
              | VariableRef
              | ParenthesizedExpression
              | FunctionCallExpr
              | DatasetAccessExpression
              | ListConstructor
              | RecordConstructor

The most basic building block for any AQL expression is the PrimaryExpr. This can be a simple literal (constant) value, a reference to a query variable that is in scope, a parenthesized expression, a function call, an expression accessing the ADM contents of a dataset, a newly constructed list of ADM instances, or a newly constructed ADM record.

Literals


Literal        ::= StringLiteral
                 | IntegerLiteral
                 | FloatLiteral
                 | DoubleLiteral
                 | "null"
                 | "true"
                 | "false"
StringLiteral  ::= ("\"" (<ESCAPE_QUOT> | ~["\""])* "\"")
                 | ("\'" (<ESCAPE_APOS> | ~["\'"])* "\'")
<ESCAPE_QUOT>  ::= "\\\""
<ESCAPE_APOS>  ::= "\\\'"
IntegerLiteral ::= <DIGITS>
<DIGITS>       ::= ["0" - "9"]+
FloatLiteral   ::= <DIGITS> ( "f" | "F" )
                 | <DIGITS> ( "." <DIGITS> ( "f" | "F" ) )?
                 | "." <DIGITS> ( "f" | "F" )
DoubleLiteral  ::= <DIGITS>
                 | <DIGITS> ( "." <DIGITS> )?
                 | "." <DIGITS>                      

Literals (constants) in AQL can be strings, integers, floating point values, double values, boolean constants, or the constant value null. The null value in AQL has ¡°unknown¡± or ¡°missing¡± value semantics, similar to (though not identical to) nulls in the relational query language SQL.
The following are some simple examples of AQL literals. Since AQL is an expression language, each example is also a complete, legal AQL query (!).

Examples


"a string"
42


Variable References


VariableRef ::= <VARIABLE>
<VARIABLE>  ::= "$" <LETTER> (<LETTER> | <DIGIT> | "_")*
<LETTER>    ::= ["A" - "Z", "a" - "z"]

A variable in AQL can be bound to any legal ADM value. A variable reference refers to the value to which an in-scope variable is bound. (E.g., a variable binding may originate from one of the for or let clauses of a FLWOR expression or from an input parameter in the context of an AQL function body.)

Examples


$tweet
$id


Parenthesized Expressions


ParenthesizedExpression ::= "(" Expression ")"

As in most languages, an expression may be parenthesized.
Since AQL is an expression language, the following example expression is actually also a complete, legal AQL query whose result is the value 2. (As such, you can have Big Fun explaining to your boss how AsterixDB and AQL can turn your 1000-node shared-nothing Big Data cluster into a $5M calculator in its spare time.)

Example


( 1 + 1 )


Function Calls


FunctionCallExpr ::= FunctionOrTypeName "(" ( Expression ( "," Expression )* )? ")"

Functions are included in AQL, like most languages, as a way to package useful functionality or to componentize complicated or reusable AQL computations. A function call is a legal AQL query expression that represents the ADM value resulting from the evaluation of its body expression with the given parameter bindings; the parameter value bindings can themselves be any AQL expressions.
The following example is a (built-in) function call expression whose value is 8.

Example


string-length("a string")


Dataset Access


DatasetAccessExpression ::= "dataset" ( ( Identifier ( "." Identifier )? )
                          | ( "(" Expression ")" ) )
Identifier              ::= <IDENTIFIER> | StringLiteral
<IDENTIFIER>            ::= <LETTER> (<LETTER> | <DIGIT> | <SPECIALCHARS>)*
<SPECIALCHARS>          ::= ["$", "_", "-"]

Querying Big Data is the main point of AsterixDB and AQL. Data in AsterixDB reside in datasets (collections of ADM records), each of which in turn resides in some namespace known as a dataverse (data universe). Data access in a query expression is accomplished via a DatasetAccessExpression. Dataset access expressions are most commonly used in FLWOR expressions, where variables are bound to their contents.
Note that the Identifier that identifies a dataset (or any other Identifier in AQL) can also be a StringLiteral. This is especially useful to avoid conficts with AQL keywords (e.g. ¡°dataset¡±, ¡°null¡±, or ¡°type¡±).
The following are three examples of legal dataset access expressions. The first one accesses a dataset called Customers in the dataverse called SalesDV. The second one accesses the Customers dataverse in whatever the current dataverse is. The third one does the same thing as the second but uses a slightly older AQL syntax.

Examples


dataset SalesDV.Customers
dataset Customers
dataset("Customers")


Constructors


ListConstructor          ::= ( OrderedListConstructor | UnorderedListConstructor )
OrderedListConstructor   ::= "[" ( Expression ( "," Expression )* )? "]"
UnorderedListConstructor ::= "{{" ( Expression ( "," Expression )* )? "}}"
RecordConstructor        ::= "{" ( FieldBinding ( "," FieldBinding )* )? "}"
FieldBinding             ::= Expression ":" Expression

A major feature of AQL is its ability to construct new ADM data instances. This is accomplished using its constructors for each of the major ADM complex object structures, namely lists (ordered or unordered) and records. Ordered lists are like JSON arrays, while unordered lists have bag (multiset) semantics. Records are built from attributes that are field-name/field-value pairs, again like JSON. (See the AsterixDB Data Model document for more details on each.)
The following examples illustrate how to construct a new ordered list with 3 items, a new unordered list with 4 items, and a new record with 2 fields, respectively. List elements can be homogeneous (as in the first example), which is the common case, or they may be heterogeneous (as in the second example). The data values and field name values used to construct lists and records in constructors are all simply AQL expressions. Thus the list elements, field names, and field values used in constructors can be simple literals (as in these three examples) or they can come from query variable references or even arbitrarily complex AQL expressions.

Examples


[ "a", "b", "c" ]

{{ 42, "forty-two", "AsterixDB!", 3.14f }}

{
  "project name": "AsterixDB"
  "project members": {{ "vinayakb", "dtabass", "chenli" }}
}


Note
When constructing nested records there needs to be a space between the closing braces to avoid confusion with the }} token that ends an unordered list constructor: { "a" : { "b" : "c" }} will fail to parse while { "a" : { "b" : "c" } } will work.

Path Expressions


ValueExpr ::= PrimaryExpr ( Field | Index )*
Field     ::= "." Identifier
Index     ::= "[" ( Expression | "?" ) "]"

Components of complex types in ADM are accessed via path expressions. Path access can be applied to the result of an AQL expression that yields an instance of such a type, e.g., a record or list instance. For records, path access is based on field names. For ordered lists, path access is based on (zero-based) array-style indexing. AQL also supports an ¡°I¡¯m feeling lucky¡± style index accessor, [?], for selecting an arbitrary element from an ordered list. Attempts to access non-existent fields or list elements produce a null (i.e., missing information) result as opposed to signaling a runtime error.
The following examples illustrate field access for a record, index-based element access for an ordered list, and also a composition thereof.


Examples


({"list": [ "a", "b", "c"]}).list

(["a", "b", "c"])[2]

({ "list": [ "a", "b", "c"]}).list[2]


Logical Expressions


OperatorExpr ::= AndExpr ( "or" AndExpr )*
AndExpr      ::= RelExpr ( "and" RelExpr )*

As in most languages, boolean expressions can be built up from smaller expressions by combining them with the logical connectives and/or. Legal boolean values in AQL are true, false, and null. (Nulls in AQL are treated much like SQL treats its unknown truth value in boolean expressions.)
The following is an example of a conjuctive range predicate in AQL. It will yield true if $a is bound to 4, null if $a is bound to null, and false otherwise.


Example


$a > 3 and $a < 5


Comparison Expressions


RelExpr ::= AddExpr ( ( "<" | ">" | "<=" | ">=" | "=" | "!=" | "~=" ) AddExpr )?

AQL has the usual list of suspects, plus one, for comparing pairs of atomic values. The ¡°plus one¡± is the last operator listed above, which is the ¡°roughly equal¡± operator provided for similarity queries. (See the separate document on AsterixDB Similarity Queries for more details on similarity matching.)
An example comparison expression (which yields the boolean value true) is shown below.


Example


5 > 3


Arithmetic Expressions


AddExpr  ::= MultExpr ( ( "+" | "-" ) MultExpr )*
MultExpr ::= UnaryExpr ( ( "*" | "/" | "%" | "^"| "idiv" ) UnaryExpr )*
UnaryExpr ::= ( ( "+" | "-" ) )? ValueExpr

AQL also supports the usual cast of characters for arithmetic expressions. The example below evaluates to 25.


Example


3 ^ 2 + 4 ^ 2


FLWOR Expression


FLWOR         ::= ( ForClause | LetClause ) ( Clause )* "return" Expression
Clause         ::= ForClause | LetClause | WhereClause | OrderbyClause
                 | GroupClause | LimitClause | DistinctClause
ForClause      ::= "for" Variable ( "at" Variable )? "in" ( Expression )
LetClause      ::= "let" Variable ":=" Expression
WhereClause    ::= "where" Expression
OrderbyClause  ::= "order" "by" Expression ( ( "asc" ) | ( "desc" ) )? 
                   ( "," Expression ( ( "asc" ) | ( "desc" ) )? )*
GroupClause    ::= "group" "by" ( Variable ":=" )? Expression ( "," ( Variable ":=" )? Expression )*
                   "with" VariableRef ( "," VariableRef )*
LimitClause    ::= "limit" Expression ( "offset" Expression )?
DistinctClause ::= "distinct" "by" Expression ( "," Expression )*
Variable       ::= <VARIABLE>

The heart of AQL is the FLWOR (for-let-where-orderby-return) expression. The roots of this expression were borrowed from the expression of the same name in XQuery. A FLWOR expression starts with one or more clauses that establish variable bindings. A for clause binds a variable incrementally to each element of its associated expression; it includes an optional positional variable for counting/numbering the bindings. By default no ordering is implied or assumed by a for clause. A let clause binds a variable to the collection of elements computed by its associated expression.
Following the initial for or let clause(s), a FLWOR expression may contain an arbitrary sequence of other clauses. The where clause in a FLWOR expression filters the preceding bindings via a boolean expression, much like a where clause does in a SQL query. The order by clause in a FLWOR expression induces an ordering on the data. The group by clause, discussed further below, forms groups based on its group by expressions, optionally naming the expressions¡¯ values (which together form the grouping key for the expression). The with subclause of a group by clause specifies the variable(s) whose values should be grouped based on the grouping key(s); following the grouping clause, only the grouping key(s) and the variables named in the with subclause remain in scope, and the named grouping variables now contain lists formed from their input values. The limit clause caps the number of values returned, optionally starting its result count from a specified offset. (Web applications can use this feature for doing pagination.) The distinct clause is similar to the group-by clause, but it forms no groups; it serves only to eliminate duplicate values. As indicated by the grammar, the clauses in an AQL query can appear in any order. To interpret a query, one can think of data as flowing down through the query from the first clause to the return clause.
The following example shows a FLWOR expression that selects and returns one user from the dataset FacebookUsers.


Example


for $user in dataset FacebookUsers
where $user.id = 8
return $user

The next example shows a FLWOR expression that joins two datasets, FacebookUsers and FacebookMessages, returning user/message pairs. The results contain one record per pair, with result records containing the user¡¯s name and an entire message.

Example


for $user in dataset FacebookUsers
for $message in dataset FacebookMessages
where $message.author-id = $user.id
return
  {
    "uname": $user.name,
    "message": $message.message
  };

In the next example, a let clause is used to bind a variable to all of a user¡¯s FacebookMessages. The query returns one record per user, with result records containing the user¡¯s name and the set of all messages by that user.

Example


for $user in dataset FacebookUsers
let $messages := 
  for $message in dataset FacebookMessages
  where $message.author-id = $user.id
  return $message.message
return
  {
    "uname": $user.name,
    "messages": $messages
  };

The following example returns all TwitterUsers ordered by their followers count (most followers first) and language. When ordering null is treated as being smaller than any other value if nulls are encountered in the ordering key(s).

Example


  for $user in dataset TwitterUsers
  order by $user.followers_count desc, $user.lang asc
  return $user

The next example illustrates the use of the group by clause in AQL. After the group by clause in the query, only variables that are either in the group by list or in the with list are in scope. The variables in the clause¡¯s with list will each contain a collection of items following the group by clause; the collected items are the values that the source variable was bound to in the tuples that formed the group. For grouping null is handled as a single value.

Example


  for $x in dataset FacebookMessages
  let $messages := $x.message
  group by $loc := $x.sender-location with $messages
  return
    {
      "location" : $loc,
      "message" : $messages
    }

The use of the limit clause is illustrated in the next example.

Example


  for $user in dataset TwitterUsers
  order by $user.followers_count desc
  limit 2
  return $user

The final example shows how AQL¡¯s distinct by clause works. Each variable in scope before the distinct clause is also in scope after the distinct by clause. This clause works similarly to group by, but for each variable that contains more than one value after the distinct by clause, one value is picked nondeterministically. (If the variable is in the distinct by list, then its value will be deterministic.) Nulls are treated as a single value when they occur in a grouping field.

Example


  for $x in dataset FacebookMessages
  distinct by $x.sender-location
  return
    {
      "location" : $x.sender-location,
      "message" : $x.message
    }


Conditional Expression


IfThenElse ::= "if" "(" Expression ")" "then" Expression "else" Expression

A conditional expression is useful for choosing between two alternative values based on a boolean condition. If its first (if) expression is true, its second (then) expression¡¯s value is returned, and otherwise its third (else) expression is returned.
The following example illustrates the form of a conditional expression.


Example


if (2 < 3) then "yes" else "no"


Quantified Expressions


QuantifiedExpression ::= ( ( "some" ) | ( "every" ) ) Variable "in" Expression
                         ( "," Variable "in" Expression )* "satisfies" Expression

Quantified expressions are used for expressing existential or universal predicates involving the elements of a collection.
The following pair of examples illustrate the use of a quantified expression to test that every (or some) element in the set [1, 2, 3] of integers is less than three. The first example yields false and second example yields true.
It is useful to note that if the set were instead the empty set, the first expression would yield true (¡°every¡± value in an empty set satisfies the condition) while the second expression would yield false (since there isn¡¯t ¡°some¡± value, as there are no values in the set, that satisfies the condition).


Examples


every $x in [ 1, 2, 3 ] satisfies $x < 3
some $x in [ 1, 2, 3 ] satisfies $x < 3


3. Statements [Back to TOC]


Statement ::= ( SingleStatement ( ";" )? )* <EOF>
SingleStatement ::= DataverseDeclaration
                  | FunctionDeclaration
                  | CreateStatement
                  | DropStatement
                  | LoadStatement
                  | SetStatement
                  | InsertStatement
                  | DeleteStatement
                  | Query                      

In addition to expresssions for queries, AQL supports a variety of statements for data definition and manipulation purposes as well as controlling the context to be used in evaluating AQL expressions. AQL supports record-level ACID transactions that begin and terminate implicitly for each record inserted, deleted, or searched while a given AQL statement is being executed.
This section details the statements supported in the AQL language.

Declarations


DataverseDeclaration ::= "use" "dataverse" Identifier

The world of data in an AsterixDB cluster is organized into data namespaces called dataverses. To set the default dataverse for a series of statements, the use dataverse statement is provided.
As an example, the following statement sets the default dataverse to be TinySocial.


Example


use dataverse TinySocial;

The set statement in AQL is used to control aspects of the expression evalation context for queries.


SetStatement ::= "set" Identifier StringLiteral

As an example, the following set statements request that Jaccard similarity with a similarity threshold 0.6 be used for set similarity matching when the ~= operator is used in a query expression.

Example


set simfunction "jaccard";
set simthreshold "0.6f"; 

When writing a complex AQL query, it can sometimes be helpful to define one or more auxilliary functions that each address a sub-piece of the overall query. The declare function statement supports the creation of such helper functions.


FunctionDeclaration  ::= "declare" "function" Identifier ParameterList "{" Expression "}"
ParameterList        ::= "(" ( <VARIABLE> ( "," <VARIABLE> )* )? ")"

The following is a very simple example of a temporary AQL function definition.

Example


declare function add($a, $b) {
  $a + $b
};


Lifecycle Management Statements


CreateStatement ::= "create" ( DataverseSpecification
                             | TypeSpecification
                             | DatasetSpecification
                             | IndexSpecification
                             | FunctionSpecification )

QualifiedName       ::= Identifier ( "." Identifier )?
DoubleQualifiedName ::= Identifier "." Identifier ( "." Identifier )?

The create statement in AQL is used for creating persistent artifacts in the context of dataverses. It can be used to create new dataverses, datatypes, datasets, indexes, and user-defined AQL functions.

Dataverses


DataverseSpecification ::= "dataverse" Identifier IfNotExists ( "with format" StringLiteral )?

The create dataverse statement is used to create new dataverses. To ease the authoring of reusable AQL scripts, its optional IfNotExists clause allows creation to be requested either unconditionally or only if the the dataverse does not already exist. If this clause is absent, an error will be returned if the specified dataverse already exists. The with format clause is a placeholder for future functionality that can safely be ignored.
The following example creates a dataverse named TinySocial.

Example


create dataverse TinySocial;


Types


TypeSpecification    ::= "type" FunctionOrTypeName IfNotExists "as" TypeExpr
FunctionOrTypeName   ::= QualifiedName
IfNotExists          ::= ( "if not exists" )?
TypeExpr             ::= RecordTypeDef | TypeReference | OrderedListTypeDef | UnorderedListTypeDef
RecordTypeDef        ::= ( "closed" | "open" )? "{" ( RecordField ( "," RecordField )* )? "}"
RecordField          ::= Identifier ":" ( TypeExpr ) ( "?" )?
TypeReference        ::= Identifier
OrderedListTypeDef   ::= "[" ( TypeExpr ) "]"
UnorderedListTypeDef ::= "{{" ( TypeExpr ) "}}"

The create type statement is used to create a new named ADM datatype. This type can then be used to create datasets or utilized when defining one or more other ADM datatypes. Much more information about the Asterix Data Model (ADM) is available in the data model reference guide to ADM. A new type can be a record type, a renaming of another type, an ordered list type, or an unordered list type. A record type can be defined as being either open or closed. Instances of a closed record type are not permitted to contain fields other than those specified in the create type statement. Instances of an open record type may carry additional fields, and open is the default for a new type (if neither option is specified).
The following example creates a new ADM record type called FacebookUser type. Since it is closed, its instances will contain only what is specified in the type definition. The first four fields are traditional typed name/value pairs. The friend-ids field is an unordered list of 32-bit integers. The employment field is an ordered list of instances of another named record type, EmploymentType.

Example


create type FacebookUserType as closed {
  "id" :         int32,
  "alias" :      string,
  "name" :       string,
  "user-since" : datetime,
  "friend-ids" : {{ int32 }},
  "employment" : [ EmploymentType ]
}


Datasets


DatasetSpecification ::= "internal"? "dataset" QualifiedName "(" Identifier ")" IfNotExists
                         PrimaryKey ( "on" Identifier )? ( "hints" Properties )? 
                       | "external" "dataset" QualifiedName "(" Identifier ")" IfNotExists 
                         "using" AdapterName Configuration ( "hints" Properties )?
AdapterName          ::= Identifier
Configuration        ::= "(" ( KeyValuePair ( "," KeyValuePair )* )? ")"
KeyValuePair         ::= "(" StringLiteral "=" StringLiteral ")"
Properties           ::= ( "(" Property ( "," Property )* ")" )?
Property             ::= Identifier "=" ( StringLiteral | IntegerLiteral )
FunctionSignature    ::= FunctionOrTypeName "@" IntegerLiteral
PrimaryKey           ::= "primary" "key" Identifier ( "," Identifier )*

The create dataset statement is used to create a new dataset. Datasets are named, unordered collections of ADM record instances; they are where data lives persistently and are the targets for queries in AsterixDB. Datasets are typed, and AsterixDB will ensure that their contents conform to their type definitions. An Internal dataset (the default) is a dataset that is stored in and managed by AsterixDB. It must have a specified unique primary key that can be used to partition data across nodes of an AsterixDB cluster. The primary key is also used in secondary indexes to uniquely identify the indexed primary data records. An External dataset is stored outside of AsterixDB (currently datasets in HDFS or on the local filesystem(s) of the cluster¡¯s nodes are supported). External dataset support allows AQL queries to treat external data as though it were stored in AsterixDB, making it possible to query ¡°legacy¡± file data (e.g., Hive data) without having to physically import it into AsterixDB. For an external dataset, an appropriate adaptor must be selected to handle the nature of the desired external data. (See the guide to external data for more information on the available adaptors.)
The following example creates an internal dataset for storing FacefookUserType records. It specifies that their id field is their primary key.

Example


create internal dataset FacebookUsers(FacebookUserType) primary key id;

The next example creates an external dataset for storing LineitemType records. The choice of the hdfs adaptor means that its data will reside in HDFS. The create statement provides parameters used by the hdfs adaptor: the URL and path needed to locate the data in HDFS and a description of the data format.

Example


create external dataset Lineitem('LineitemType) using hdfs (
  ("hdfs"="hdfs://HOST:PORT"),
  ("path"="HDFS_PATH"),
  ("input-format"="text-input-format"),
  ("format"="delimited-text"),
  ("delimiter"="|"));


Indices


IndexSpecification ::= "index" Identifier IfNotExists "on" QualifiedName 
                       "(" ( Identifier ) ( "," Identifier )* ")" ( "type" IndexType )?
IndexType          ::= "btree"
                     | "rtree"
                     | "keyword"
                     | "ngram" "(" IntegerLiteral ")"

The create index statement creates a secondary index on one or more fields of a specified dataset. Supported index types include btree for totally ordered datatypes, rtree for spatial data, and keyword and ngram for textual (string) data. AsterixDB currently requires indexed fields to be part of the named type associated with a dataset. (Future plans include support for indexing of open fields as well.)
The following example creates a btree index called fbAuthorIdx on the author-id field of the FacebookMessages dataset. This index can be useful for accelerating exact-match queries, range search queries, and joins involving the author-id field.

Example


create index fbAuthorIdx on FacebookMessages(author-id) type btree;

The following example creates an rtree index called fbSenderLocIdx on the sender-location field of the FacebookMessages dataset. This index can be useful for accelerating queries that use the spatial-intersect function in a predicate involving the sender-location field.

Example


create index fbSenderLocIndex on FacebookMessages(sender-location) type rtree;

The following example creates a 3-gram index called fbUserIdx on the name field of the FacebookUsers dataset. This index can be used to accelerate some similarity or substring maching queries on the name field. For details refer to the document on similarity queries.

Example


create index fbUserIdx on FacebookUsers(name) type ngram(3);

The following example creates a keyword index called fbMessageIdx on the message field of the FacebookMessages dataset. This keyword index can be used to optimize queries with token-based similarity predicates on the message field. For details refer to the document on similarity queries.

Example


create index fbMessageIdx on FacebookMessages(message) type keyword;


Functions
The create function statement creates a named function that can then be used and reused in AQL queries. The body of a function can be any AQL expression involving the function¡¯s parameters.


FunctionSpecification ::= "function" FunctionOrTypeName IfNotExists ParameterList "{" Expression "}"

The following is a very simple example of a create function statement. It differs from the declare function example shown previously in that it results in a function that is persistently registered by name in the specified dataverse.

Example


create function add($a, $b) {
  $a + $b
};


Removal


DropStatement       ::= "drop" ( "dataverse" Identifier IfExists
                               | "type" FunctionOrTypeName IfExists
                               | "dataset" QualifiedName IfExists
                               | "index" DoubleQualifiedName IfExists
                               | "function" FunctionSignature IfExists )
IfExists            ::= ( "if" "exists" )?

The drop statement in AQL is the inverse of the create statement. It can be used to drop dataverses, datatypes, datasets, indexes, and functions.
The following examples illustrate uses of the drop statement.

Example


drop dataset FacebookUsers if exists;

drop index fbSenderLocIndex;

drop type FacebookUserType;

drop dataverse TinySocial;

drop function add;


Import/Export Statements


LoadStatement  ::= "load" "dataset" QualifiedName "using" AdapterName Configuration ( "pre-sorted" )?

The load statement is used to initially populate a dataset via bulk loading of data from an external file. An appropriate adaptor must be selected to handle the nature of the desired external data. The load statement accepts the same adaptors and the same parameters as external datasets. (See the guide to external data for more information on the available adaptors.)
The following example shows how to bulk load the FacebookUsers dataset from an external file containing data that has been prepared in ADM format.


Example


load dataset FacebookUsers using localfs
(("path"="localhost:///Users/zuck/AsterixDB/load/fbu.adm"),("format"="adm"));


Modification Statements

Insert


InsertStatement ::= "insert" "into" "dataset" QualifiedName Query

The AQL insert statement is used to insert data into a dataset. The data to be inserted comes from an AQL query expression. The expression can be as simple as a constant expression, or in general it can be any legal AQL query. Inserts in AsterixDB are processed transactionally, with the scope of each insert transaction being the insertion of a single object plus its affiliated secondary index entries (if any). If the query part of an insert returns a single object, then the insert statement itself will be a single, atomic transaction. If the query part returns multiple objects, then each object inserted will be handled independently as a tranaction.
The following example illustrates a query-based insertion.

Example


insert into dataset UsersCopy (for $user in dataset FacebookUsers return $user


Delete


DeleteStatement ::= "delete" Variable "from" "dataset" QualifiedName ( "where" Expression )?

The AQL delete statement is used to delete data from a target dataset. The data to be deleted is identified by a boolean expression involving the variable bound to the target dataset in the delete statement. Deletes in AsterixDB are processed transactionally, with the scope of each delete transaction being the deletion of a single object plus its affiliated secondary index entries (if any). If the boolean expression for a delete identifies a single object, then the delete statement itself will be a single, atomic transaction. If the expression identifies multiple objects, then each object deleted will be handled independently as a transaction.
The following example illustrates a single-object deletion.

Example


delete $user from dataset FacebookUsers where $user.id = 8;

We close this guide to AQL with one final example of a query expression.

Example


for $praise in {{ "great", "brilliant", "awesome" }}
return
   string-concat(["AsterixDB is ", $praise])

IntroductionAdapter for an External DatasetCreating an External DatasetWriting Queries against an External Dataset

Introduction [Back to TOC]
Data that needs to be processed by ASTERIX could be residing outside ASTERIX storage. Examples include data files on a distributed file system such as HDFS or on the local file system of a machine that is part of an ASTERIX cluster. For ASTERIX to process such data, end-user may create a regular dataset in ASTERIX (a.k.a. internal dataset) and load the dataset with the data. ASTERIX supports ¡®¡®external datasets¡¯¡¯ so that it is not necessary to ¡°load¡± all data prior to using it. This also avoids creating multiple copies of data and the need to keep the copies in sync.

Adapter for an External Dataset [Back to TOC]
External data is accessed using wrappers (adapters in ASTERIX) that abstract away the mechanism of connecting with an external service, receiving data and transforming the data into ADM records that are understood by ASTERIX. ASTERIX comes with built-in adapters for common storage systems such as HDFS or the local file system.

Creating an External Dataset [Back to TOC]
As an example we consider the Lineitem dataset from TPCH schema.
We assume that you have successfully created an ASTERIX instance following the instructions at Installing Asterix Using Managix. For constructing an example, we assume a single machine setup.
Similar to a regular dataset, an external dataset has an associated datatype. We shall first create the datatype associated with each record in Lineitem data. Paste the following in the query textbox on the webpage at http://127.0.0.1:19001 and hit ¡®Execute¡¯.


    create dataverse ExternalFileDemo;
    use dataverse ExternalFileDemo;

    create type LineitemType as closed {
      l_orderkey:int32,
      l_partkey: int32,
      l_suppkey: int32,
      l_linenumber: int32,
      l_quantity: double,
      l_extendedprice: double,
      l_discount: double,
      l_tax: double,
      l_returnflag: string,
      l_linestatus: string,
      l_shipdate: string,
      l_commitdate: string,
      l_receiptdate: string,
      l_shipinstruct: string,
      l_shipmode: string,
      l_comment: string}

We describe here two scenarios.

1) Data file resides on the local file system of a host
Prerequisite: The host is a part of the ASTERIX cluster.
Earlier, we assumed a single machine ASTERIX setup. To satisfy the prerequisite, log-in to the machine running ASTERIX.

Download the data file to an appropriate location. We denote this location by SOURCE_PATH.
ASTERIX provides a built-in adapter for data residing on the local file system. The adapter is referred by its alias- ¡®localfs¡¯. We create an external dataset named Lineitem and use the ¡®localfs¡¯ adapter.


    create external dataset Lineitem(LineitemType)
    using localfs

Above, the definition is not complete as we need to provide a set of parameters that are specific to the source file.

 Parameter  Description  path  A fully qualified path of the form host://<absolute path>. 
  Use a comma separated list if there are multiple files. 
  E.g. host1://<absolute path>, host2://<absolute path> and so forth.  format  The format for the content. Use 'adm' for data in ADM (ASTERIX Data Model) or JSON format. Use 'delimited-text' if fields are separted by . delimiterThe delimiting character in the source file if format is 'delimited text'
As we are using a single single machine ASTERIX instance, we use 127.0.0.1 as host in the path parameter. We complete the create dataset statement as follows.


    use dataverse ExternalFileDemo;

    create external dataset Lineitem(LineitemType)
    using localfs
    (("path"="127.0.0.1://SOURCE_PATH"),
    ("format"="delimited-text"),
    ("delimiter"="|"));

Please substitute SOURCE_PATH with the absolute path to the source file on the local file system.

Common source of error
An incorrect value for the path parameter will give the following exception message when the dataset is used in a query.


    edu.uci.ics.hyracks.algebricks.common.exceptions.AlgebricksException: edu.uci.ics.hyracks.api.exceptions.HyracksDataException: edu.uci.ics.hyracks.api.exceptions.HyracksDataException: Job failed.

Verify the correctness of the path parameter provided to the localfs adapter. Note that the path parameter must be an absolute path to the data file. For e.g. if you saved your file in your home directory (assume it to be /home/joe), then the path value should be


    127.0.0.1:///home/joe/lineitem.tbl.

In your web-browser, navigate to 127.0.0.1:19001 and paste the above to the query text box. Finally hit ¡®Execute¡¯.
Next we move over to the the section Writing Queries against an External Dataset and try a sample query against the external dataset.

2) Data file resides on an HDFS instance
Pre-requisite: It is required that the Namenode and atleast one of the HDFS Datanodes are reachable from the hosts that form the ASTERIX cluster. ASTERIX provides a built-in adapter for data residing on HDFS. The HDFS adapter is referred (in AQL) by its alias - ¡®hdfs¡¯. We create an external dataset named Lineitem and associate the HDFS adapter with it.


    create external dataset Lineitem(LineitemType)
    using hdfs

The above statement is not complete as we need to provide a set of parameters specific to the HDFS instance and the source file. These parameters are described below.

 Parameter  Description  hdfs  The HDFS URL  path  The absolute path to the source HDFS file. Use a comma separated list if there are multiple files.  input-format  The associated input format. Use 'text-input-format' for textual data or 'sequence-input-format' for binary data (sequence files).  format  The format for the content. Use 'adm' for data in ADM (ASTERIX Data Model) or 
  JSON format and use 'delimited-text' for delimited data 
  that has fields separated by a delimiting character.  delimiter  The delimiting character in the source file if format is 'delimited text' 
Difference between ¡®input-format¡¯ and ¡®format¡¯
input-format: File stored under HDFS have an associated storage format For example, TextInputFormat represents plain text files. SequenceFileInputFormat indicates binary compressed file. The parameter ¡®input-format¡¯ is used to distinguish between these two kind of files.
format: The parameter ¡®format¡¯ refers to the type of the data contained in the file. For example data contained in a file could be in json, ADM format or could be delimited-text with fields separated by a delimiting character.
As an example. consider the data file. The file is a text file with each line representing a record. The fields in each record are separated by the ¡®|¡¯ character.
We assume the HDFS URL to be hdfs://host:port. We further assume that the example data file is copied to the HDFS at a path denoted by HDFS_PATH.
The complete set of parameters for our example file are as follows. ((¡°hdfs¡±=¡°HDFS_URL¡±,(¡°path¡±=¡°HDFS_PATH¡±),(¡°input-format¡±=¡°text-input-format¡±),(¡°format¡±=¡°delimited-text¡±),(¡°delimiter¡±=¡°|¡±))
We modify the create external dataset statement as follows.


    create external dataset Lineitem('LineitemType)
    using hdfs
    (("hdfs"="HDFS_URL"),("path"="HDFS_PATH"),("input-format"="text-input-format"),("format"="delimited-text"),("delimiter"="|"));

Once you have copied the source data file to your HDFS instance, substitute the values of HDFS_URL and HDFS_PATH in the above statement. In your web-browser, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:19001 and execute the above statement with substituted values.
You may now run the sample query in next section.

Writing Queries against an External Dataset [Back to TOC]
You may write AQL queries against an external dataset. Following is an example AQL query that applies a filter and returns an ordered result.


    use dataverse ExternalFileDemo;

    for $c in dataset('Lineitem')
    where $c.l_orderkey <= 3
    order by $c.l_orderkey, $c.l_linenumber
    return $c

The expected result is:

Asynchronous Result API [Back to TOC]
End point to fetch the results of an asynchronous query
Endpoint: /query/result
Parameters:

ParameterDescriptionRequired?handleResult handle that was returned by a previous call to a /query call with mode = asynchronousYes
Result: The result is returned as a JSON object as follows:


    {
       results: <result as a string, if mode = synchronous, or mode = asynchronous and results are available>
       error-code: [<code>, <message>] (if an error occurs)
    }

If mode = asynchronous and results are not available, the returned JSON object is empty: { }

Example

Fetching results for asynchronous query
We use the handle returned by the asynchronous query to get the results for the query. The handle returned was:


    {
        "handle": [45,0]
    }

            AsterixDB Javascript SDK

Obtaining and Including
Download the javascript SDK and include it like any other javascript library by adding the following line in the appropriate HTML file:


<script src="path/to/asterix-sdk-stable.js"></script>


Interactive Demos
There are two interactive demos that are available for download. Both of the demos illustrate how the javascript API would be used in an application:

Tweetbook Demo: a contrived geo-spatial  application dealing with artificial Tweets allowing spatial, temporal, and  keyword-based filtering.ADM/AQL 101 Demo: an interactive version of  all of the examples that are provided in the following section.

The javascript SDK: by example
In this section, we explore how to form AQL queries using the javascript SDK. The queries from AsterixDB 101: An ADM and AQL Primer are used as examples here. For each AQL statement, the equivalent javascript expression is shown below it, followed by the results of executing the query.

            AsterixDB Support of Similarity Queries

Table of Contents

MotivationData Types and Similarity FunctionsSimilarity Selection QueriesSimilarity Join QueriesUsing Indexes to Support Similarity Queries

Motivation [Back to TOC]
Similarity queries are widely used in applications where users need to find records that satisfy a similarity predicate, while exact matching is not sufficient. These queries are especially important for social and Web applications, where errors, abbreviations, and inconsistencies are common. As an example, we may want to find all the movies starring Schwarzenegger, while we don¡¯t know the exact spelling of his last name (despite his popularity in both the movie industry and politics :-)). As another example, we want to find all the Facebook users who have similar friends. To meet this type of needs, AsterixDB supports similarity queries using efficient indexes and algorithms.

Data Types and Similarity Functions [Back to TOC]
AsterixDB supports edit distance (on strings) and Jaccard (on sets). For instance, in our TinySocial example, the friend-ids of a Facebook user forms a set of friends, and we can define a similarity between the sets of friends of two users. We can also convert a string to a set of grams of a length ¡°n¡± (called ¡°n-grams¡±) and define the Jaccard similarity between the two gram sets of the two strings. Formally, the ¡°n-grams¡± of a string are its substrings of length ¡°n¡±. For instance, the 3-grams of the string schwarzenegger are sch, chw, hwa, ¡­, ger.
AsterixDB provides tokenization functions to convert strings to sets, and the similarity functions.

Similarity Selection Queries [Back to TOC]
The following query asks for all the Facebook users whose name is similar to Suzanna Tilson, i.e., their edit distance is at most 2.


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    for $user in dataset('FacebookUsers')
    let $ed := edit-distance($user.name, "Suzanna Tilson")
    where $ed <= 2
    return $user

The following query asks for all the Facebook users whose set of friend ids is similar to [1,5,9], i.e., their Jaccard similarity is at least 0.6.


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    for $user in dataset('FacebookUsers')
    let $sim := similarity-jaccard($user.friend-ids, [1,5,9])
    where $sim >= 0.6f
    return $user

AsterixDB allows a user to use a similarity operator ~= to express a condition by defining the similarity function and threshold using ¡°set¡± statements earlier. For instance, the above query can be equivalently written as:


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    set simfunction "jaccard";
    set simthreshold "0.6f";

    for $user in dataset('FacebookUsers')
    where $user.friend-ids ~= [1,5,9]
    return $user

In this query, we first declare Jaccard as the similarity function using simfunction and then specify the threshold 0.6f using simthreshold.

Similarity Join Queries [Back to TOC]
AsterixDB supports fuzzy joins between two sets. The following query finds, for each Facebook user, all Twitter users with names similar to their name based on the edit distance.


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    set simfunction "edit-distance";
    set simthreshold "3";

    for $fbu in dataset FacebookUsers
    return {
        "id": $fbu.id,
        "name": $fbu.name,
        "similar-users": for $t in dataset TweetMessages
                            let $tu := $t.user
                            where $tu.name ~= $fbu.name
                            return {
                            "twitter-screenname": $tu.screen-name,
                            "twitter-name": $tu.name
                            }
    };


Using Indexes to Support Similarity Queries [Back to TOC]
AsterixDB uses two types of indexes to support similarity queries, namely ¡°ngram index¡± and ¡°keyword index¡±.

NGram Index
An ¡°ngram index¡± is constructed on a set of strings. We generate n-grams for each string, and build an inverted list for each n-gram that includes the ids of the strings with this gram. A similarity query can be answered efficiently by accessing the inverted lists of the grams in the query and counting the number of occurrences of the string ids on these inverted lists. The similar idea can be used to answer queries with Jaccard similarity. A detailed description of these techniques is available at this paper.
For instance, the following DDL statements create an ngram index on the FacebookUsers.name attribute using an inverted index of 3-grams.


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    create index fbUserIdx on FacebookUsers(name) type ngram(3);

The number ¡°3¡± in ¡°ngram(3)¡± is the length ¡°n¡± in the grams. This index can be used to optimize similarity queries on this attribute using edit-distance, edit-distance-check, jaccard, or jaccard-check queries on this attribute where the similarity is defined on sets of 3-grams. This index can also be used to optimize queries with the ¡°contains()¡± predicate (i.e., substring matching) since it can be also be solved by counting on the inverted lists of the grams in the query string.

Keyword Index
A ¡°keyword index¡± is constructed on a set of strings or sets (e.g., OrderedList, UnorderedList). Instead of generating grams as in an ngram index, we generate tokens (e.g., words) and for each token, construct an inverted list that includes the ids of the records with this token. The following two examples show how to create keyword index on two different types:

Keyword Index on String Type


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    create index fbMessageIdx on FacebookMessages(message) type keyword;

    for $o in dataset('FacebookMessages')
    let $jacc := similarity-jaccard-check(word-tokens($o.message), word-tokens("love like verizon"), 0.2f)
    where $jacc[0]
    return $o


Keyword Index on UnorderedList Type


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    create index fbUserIdx_fids on FacebookUsers(friend-ids) type keyword;

    for $c in dataset('FacebookUsers')
    let $jacc := similarity-jaccard-check($c.friend-ids, {{3,10}}, 0.5f)
    where $jacc[0]
    return $c

As shown above, keyword index can be used to optimize queries with token-based similarity predicates, including similarity-jaccard and similarity-jaccard-check.

About Allen¡¯s RelationsAllen¡¯s Relations Functions

About Allen¡¯s Relations [Back to TOC]
AsterixDB supports Allen¡¯s relations over interval types. Allen¡¯s relations are also called Allen¡¯s interval algebra. There are totally 13 base relations described by this algebra, and all of them are supported in AsterixDB (note that interval-equals is supported by the = comparison symbol so there is no extra function for it). 
A detailed description of Allen¡¯s relations can be found from its wikipedia entry. 

Allen¡¯s Relations Functions [Back to TOC]

interval-before, interval-after


Syntax:
  

interval-before(interval1, interval2)
interval-after(interval1, interval2)

These two functions check whether an interval happens before/after another interval. Arguments:
  
interval1, interval2: two intervals to be compared
Return Value:
A boolean value. Specifically, interval-before(interval1, interval2) is true if and only if interval1.end < interval2.start, and interval-after(interval1, interval2) is true if and only if interval1.start > interval2.end. If any of the two inputs is null, null is returned.
Examples:
  

let $itv1 := interval-from-date("2000-01-01", "2005-01-01")
let $itv2 := interval-from-date("2005-05-01", "2012-09-09")
return {"interval-before": interval-before($itv1, $itv2), "interval-after": interval-after($itv2, $itv1)}

The expected result is:
  

{ "interval-before": true, "interval-after": true }


interval-meets, interval-met-by


Syntax:
  

interval-meets(interval1, interval2)
interval-met-by(interval1, interval2)

These two functions check whether an interval meets with another interval. Arguments:
  
interval1, interval2: two intervals to be compared
Return Value:
A boolean value. Specifically, interval-meets(interval1, interval2) is true if and only if interval1.end = interval2.start, and interval-met-by(interval1, interval2) is true if and only if interval1.start = interval2.end. If any of the two inputs is null, null is returned.
Examples:
  

let $itv1 := interval-from-date("2000-01-01", "2005-01-01")
let $itv2 := interval-from-date("2005-01-01", "2012-09-09")
let $itv3 := interval-from-date("2006-08-01", "2007-03-01")
let $itv4 := interval-from-date("2004-09-10", "2006-08-01")
return {"meets": interval-meets($itv1, $itv2), "metby": interval-met-by($itv3, $itv4)}

The expected result is:
  

{ "meets": true, "metby": true }


interval-overlaps, interval-overlapped-by, overlap


Syntax:
  

interval-overlaps(interval1, interval2)
interval-overlapped-by(interval1, interval2)
overlap(interval1, interval2)

These functions check whether two intervals overlap with each other.Arguments:
  
interval1, interval2: two intervals to be compared
Return Value:
A boolean value. Specifically, interval-overlaps(interval1, interval2) is true if and only if
  

interval1.start < interval2.start
AND interval2.end > interval1.end
AND interval1.end > interval2.start

interval-overlapped-by(interval1, interval2) is true if and only if
  

interval2.start < interval1.start
AND interval1.end > interval2.end
AND interval2.end > interval1.start

overlap(interval1, interval2) is true if
  

(interval2.start >= interval1.start
AND interval2.start < interval1.end)
OR
(interval2.end > interval1.start
AND interval2.end <= interval.end)

For all these functions, if any of the two inputs is null, null is returned.
Note that interval-overlaps and interval-overlapped-by are following the Allen¡¯s relations on the definition of overlap. overlap is a syntactic sugar for the case that the intersect of two intervals is not empty.
Examples:
  

let $itv1 := interval-from-date("2000-01-01", "2005-01-01")
let $itv2 := interval-from-date("2004-05-01", "2012-09-09")
let $itv3 := interval-from-date("2006-08-01", "2007-03-01")
let $itv4 := interval-from-date("2004-09-10", "2006-12-31")
return {"overlaps": interval-overlaps($itv1, $itv2), 
        "overlapped-by": interval-overlapped-by($itv3, $itv4), 
        "overlapping1": overlap($itv1, $itv2), 
        "overlapping2": overlap($itv3, $itv4)}

The expected result is:
  

{ "overlaps": true, "overlapped-by": true, "overlapping1": true, "overlapping2": true }


interval-starts, interval-started-by


Syntax:
  

interval-starts(interval1, interval2)
interval-started-by(interval1, interval2)

These two functions check whether one interval starts with the other interval.Arguments:
  
interval1, interval2: two intervals to be compared
Return Value:
A boolean value. Specifically, interval-starts(interval1, interval2) returns true if and only if
  

interval1.start = interval2.start
AND interval1.end <= interval2.end

interval-started-by(interval1, interval2) returns true if and only if
  

interval1.start = interval2.start
AND interval2.end <= interval1.end

For both functions, if any of the two inputs is null, null is returned.
Examples:
  

let $itv1 := interval-from-date("2000-01-01", "2005-01-01")
let $itv2 := interval-from-date("2000-01-01", "2012-09-09")
let $itv3 := interval-from-date("2006-08-01", "2007-03-01")
let $itv4 := interval-from-date("2006-08-01", "2006-08-01")
return {"interval-starts": interval-starts($itv1, $itv2), "interval-started-by": interval-started-by($itv3, $itv4)}

The expected result is:
  

{ "interval-starts": true, "interval-started-by": true }


interval-covers, interval-covered-by


Syntax:
  

interval-covers(interval1, interval2)
interval-covered-by(interval1, interval2)

These two functions check whether one interval covers the other interval.Arguments:
  
interval1, interval2: two intervals to be compared
Return Value:
A boolean value. Specifically, interval-covers(interval1, interval2) is true if and only if
  

interval1.start <= interval2.start
AND interval2.end >= interval1.end

interval-covered-by(interval1, interval2) is true if and only if
  

interval2.start <= interval1.start
AND interval1.end >= interval2.end

For both functions, if any of the two inputs is null, null is returned.
Examples:
  

let $itv1 := interval-from-date("2000-01-01", "2005-01-01")
let $itv2 := interval-from-date("2000-03-01", "2004-09-09")
let $itv3 := interval-from-date("2006-08-01", "2007-03-01")
let $itv4 := interval-from-date("2004-09-10", "2012-08-01")
return {"interval-covers": interval-covers($itv1, $itv2), "interval-covered-by": interval-covered-by($itv3, $itv4)}

The expected result is:
  

{ "interval-covers": true, "interval-covered-by": true }


interval-ends, interval-ended-by


Syntax:
  

interval-ends(interval1, interval2)
interval-ended-by(interval1, interval2)

These two functions check whether one interval ends with the other interval.Arguments:
  
interval1, interval2: two intervals to be compared
Return Value:
A boolean value. Specifically, interval-ends(interval1, interval2) returns true if and only if
  

interval1.end = interval2.end

An instance of Asterix data model (ADM) can be a primitive type (int32, int64, string, float, double, date, time, datetime, etc. or null) or a derived type.

Primitive Types [Back to TOC]

Boolean[Back to TOC]
boolean data type can have one of the two values: true or false.


Example:
  

let $t := true
let $f := false
return { "true": $t, "false": $f }



The expected result is:
  

{ "true": true, "false": false }


Int8 / Int16 / Int32 / Int64 [Back to TOC]
Integer types using 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits. The ranges of these types are:

int8: -127 to 127int16: -32767 to 32767int32: -2147483647 to 2147483647int64: -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807
Example:
  

let $v8 := int8("125")
let $v16 := int16("32765")
let $v32 := 294967295
let $v64 := int64("1700000000000000000")
return { "int8": $v8, "int16": $v16, "int32": $v32, "int64": $v64}



The expected result is:
  

{ "int8": 125i8, "int16": 32765i16, "int32": 294967295, "int64": 1700000000000000000i64 }


Float [Back to TOC]
float represents approximate numeric data values using 4 bytes. The range of a float value can be from 2^(-149) to (2-2^(-23)¡¤2^(127) for both positive and negative. Beyond these ranges will get INF or -INF.


Example:
  

let $v1 := float("NaN")
let $v2 := float("INF")
let $v3 := float("-INF")
let $v4 := float("-2013.5")
return { "v1": $v1, "v2": $v2, "v3": $v3, "v4": $v4 }



The expected result is:
  

{ "v1": NaNf, "v2": Infinityf, "v3": -Infinityf, "v4": -2013.5f }


Double [Back to TOC]
double represents approximate numeric data values using 8 bytes. The range of a double value can be from (2^(-1022)) to (2-2^(-52))¡¤2^(1023) for both positive and negative. Beyond these ranges will get INF or -INF.


Example:
  

let $v1 := double("NaN")
let $v2 := double("INF")
let $v3 := double("-INF")
let $v4 := double("-2013.593823748327284")
return { "v1": $v1, "v2": $v2, "v3": $v3, "v4": $v4 }



The expected result is:
  

{ "v1": NaNd, "v2": Infinityd, "v3": -Infinityd, "v4": -2013.5938237483274d }


String [Back to TOC]
string represents a sequence of characters.


Example:
  

let $v1 := string("This is a string.")
let $v2 := string("\"This is a quoted string\"")
return { "v1": $v1, "v2": $v2 }



The expected result is:
  

{ "v1": "This is a string.", "v2": "\"This is a quoted string\"" }


Point [Back to TOC]
point is the fundamental two-dimensional building block for spatial types. It consists of two double coordinates x and y.


Example:
  

let $v1 := point("80.10d, -10E5")
let $v2 := point("5.10E-10d, -10E5")
return { "v1": $v1, "v2": $v2 }



The expected result is:
  

{ "v1": point("80.1,-1000000.0"), "v2": point("5.1E-10,-1000000.0") }


Line [Back to TOC]
line consists of two points that represent the start and the end points of a line segment.


Example:
  

let $v1 := line("10.1234,11.1e-1 +10.2E-2,-11.22")
let $v2 := line("0.1234,-1.00e-10 +10.5E-2,-01.02")
return { "v1": $v1, "v2": $v2 }



The expected result is:
  

{ "v1": line("10.1234,1.11 0.102,-11.22"), "v2": line("0.1234,-1.0E-10 0.105,-1.02") }


Rectangle[Back to TOC]
rectangle consists of two points that represent the bottom left and upper right corners of a rectangle.


Example:
  

let $v1 := rectangle("5.1,11.8 87.6,15.6548")
let $v2 := rectangle("0.1234,-1.00e-10 5.5487,0.48765")
return { "v1": $v1, "v2": $v2 }



The expected result is:
  

{ "v1": rectangle("5.1,11.8 87.6,15.6548"), "v2": rectangle("0.1234,-1.0E-10 5.5487,0.48765") }


Circle[Back to TOC]
circle consists of one point that represents the center of the circle and a radius of type double.


Example:
  

let $v1 := circle("10.1234,11.1e-1 +10.2E-2")
let $v2 := circle("0.1234,-1.00e-10 +10.5E-2")
return { "v1": $v1, "v2": $v2 }



The expected result is:
  

{ "v1": circle("10.1234,1.11 0.102"), "v2": circle("0.1234,-1.0E-10 0.105") }


Polygon[Back to TOC]
polygon consists of n points that represent the vertices of a simple closed polygon.


Example:
  

let $v1 := polygon("-1.2,+1.3e2 -2.14E+5,2.15 -3.5e+2,03.6 -4.6E-3,+4.81")
let $v2 := polygon("-1.0,+10.5e2 -02.15E+50,2.5 -1.0,+3.3e3 -2.50E+05,20.15 +3.5e+2,03.6 -4.60E-3,+4.75 -2,+1.0e2 -2.00E+5,20.10 30.5,03.25 -4.33E-3,+4.75")
return { "v1": $v1, "v2": $v2 }



The expected result is:
  

{ "v1": polygon("-1.2,130.0 -214000.0,2.15 -350.0,3.6 -0.0046,4.81"), "v2": polygon("-1.0,1050.0 -2.15E50,2.5 -1.0,3300.0 -250000.0,20.15 350.0,3.6 -0.0046,4.75 -2.0,100.0 -200000.0,20.1 30.5,3.25 -0.00433,4.75") }


Date[Back to TOC]
date represents a time point along the Gregorian calendar system specified by the year, month and day. ASTERIX supports the date from -9999-01-01 to 9999-12-31.
A date value can be represented in two formats, extended format and basic format.

Extended format is represented as [-]yyyy-mm-dd for year-month-day. Each field should be padded if there are less digits than the format specified.Basic format is in the format of [-]yyyymmdd.
Example:
  

let $v1 := date("2013-01-01")
let $v2 := date("-19700101")
return { "v1": $v1, "v2": $v2 }



The expected result is:
  

{ "v1": date("2013-01-01"), "v2": date("-1970-01-01") }


Time[Back to TOC]
time type describes the time within the range of a day. It is represented by three fields: hour, minute and second. Millisecond field is optional as the fraction of the second field. Its extended format is as hh:mm:ss[.mmm] and the basic format is hhmmss[mmm]. The value domain is from 00:00:00.000 to 23:59:59.999.
Timezone field is optional for a time value. Timezone is represented as [+|-]hh:mm for extended format or [+|-]hhmm for basic format. Note that the sign designators cannot be omitted. Z can also be used to represent the UTC local time. If no timezone information is given, it is UTC by default.


Example:
  

let $v1 := time("12:12:12.039Z")
let $v2 := time("000000000-0800")
return { "v1": $v1, "v2": $v2 }



The expected result is:
  

{ "v1": time("12:12:12.039Z"), "v2": time("08:00:00.000Z") }


Datetime[Back to TOC]
A datetime value is a combination of an date and time, representing a fixed time point along the Gregorian calendar system. The value is among -9999-01-01 00:00:00.000 and 9999-12-31 23:59:59.999.
A datetime value is represented as a combination of the representation of its date part and time part, separated by a separator T. Either extended or basic format can be used, and the two parts should be the same format.
Millisecond field and timezone field are optional, as specified in the time type.


Example:
  

let $v1 := datetime("2013-01-01T12:12:12.039Z")
let $v2 := datetime("-19700101T000000000-0800")
return { "v1": $v1, "v2": $v2 }



The expected result is:
  

{ "v1": datetime("2013-01-01T12:12:12.039Z"), "v2": datetime("-1970-01-01T08:00:00.000Z") }


Duration/Year-month-duration/Day-time-duration[Back to TOC]
duration represents a duration of time. A duration value is specified by integers on at least one of the following fields: year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond.
A duration value is in the format of [-]PnYnMnDTnHnMn.mmmS. The millisecond part (as the fraction of the second field) is optional, and when no millisecond field is used, the decimal point should also be absent.
Negative durations are also supported for the arithmetic operations between time instance types (date, time and datetime), and is used to roll the time back for the given duration. For example date("2012-01-01") + duration("-P3D") will return date("2011-12-29").
There are also two sub-duration types, namely year-month-duration and day-time-duration. year-month-duration represents only the years and months of a duration, while day-time-duration represents only the day to millisecond fields. Different from the duration type, both these two subtypes are totally ordered, so they can be used for comparison and index construction.
Note that a canonical representation of the duration is always returned, regardless whether the duration is in the canonical representation or not from the user¡¯s input. More information about canonical representation can be found from XPath dayTimeDuration Canonical Representation and yearMonthDuration Canonical Representation.


Example:
  

let $v1 := duration("P100Y12MT12M")
let $v2 := duration("-PT20.943S")
return { "v1": $v1, "v2": $v2 }



The expected result is:
  

{ "v1": duration("P101YT12M"), "v2": duration("-PT20.943S") }


Interval[Back to TOC]
interval represents inclusive-exclusive ranges of time. It is defined by two time point values with the same temporal type(date, time or datetime).


Example:
  

let $v1 := interval-from-date(date("2013-01-01"), date("20130505"))
let $v2 := interval-from-time(time("00:01:01"), time("213901049+0800"))
let $v3 := interval-from-datetime(datetime("2013-01-01T00:01:01"), datetime("20130505T213901049+0800"))
return { "v1": $v1, "v2": $v2, "v3": $v3 }



The expected result is:
  

{ "v1": interval-date("2013-01-01, 2013-05-05"), "v2": interval-time("00:01:01.000Z, 13:39:01.049Z"), "v3": interval-datetime("2013-01-01T00:01:01.000Z, 2013-05-05T13:39:01.049Z") }


Derived Types[Back to TOC]

Record[Back to TOC]
A record contains a set of ?elds, where each ?eld is described by its name and type. A record type is either open or closed. Open records can contain ?elds that are not part of the type de?nition, while closed records cannot. Syntactically, record constructors are surrounded by curly braces ¡°{¡­}¡±.
An example would be


    { "id": 213508, "name": "Alice Bob" }


OrderedList[Back to TOC]
An orderedList is a sequence of values for which the order is determined by creation or insertion. OrderedList constructors are denoted by brackets: ¡°[¡­]¡±.
An example would be


    ["alice", 123, "bob", null]


UnorderedList[Back to TOC]
An unorderedList is an unordered sequence of values, similar to bags in SQL. UnorderedList constructors are denoted by two opening flower braces followed by data and two closing flower braces, like ¡°{{¡­}}¡±.
An example would be


    {{"hello", 9328, "world", [1, 2, null]}}

            AsterixDB 101: An ADM and AQL Primer

Welcome to AsterixDB!
This document introduces the main features of AsterixDB¡¯s data model (ADM) and query language (AQL) by example. The example is a simple scenario involving (synthetic) sample data modeled after data from the social domain. This document describes a set of sample ADM datasets, together with a set of illustrative AQL queries, to introduce you to the ¡°AsterixDB user experience¡±. The complete set of steps required to create and load a handful of sample datasets, along with runnable queries and the expected results for each query, are included.
This document assumes that you are at least vaguely familiar with AsterixDB and why you might want to use it. Most importantly, it assumes you already have a running instance of AsterixDB and that you know how to query it using AsterixDB¡¯s basic web interface. For more information on these topics, you should go through the steps in Installing Asterix Using Managix before reading this document and make sure that you have a running AsterixDB instance ready to go. To get your feet wet, you should probably start with a simple local installation of AsterixDB on your favorite machine, accepting all of the default settings that Managix offers. Later you can graduate to trying AsterixDB on a cluster, its real intended home (since it targets Big Data). (Note: With the exception of specifying the correct locations where you put the source data for this example, there should no changes needed in your ADM or AQL statements to run the examples locally and/or to run them on a cluster when you are ready to take that step.)
As you read through this document, you should try each step for yourself on your own AsterixDB instance. Once you have reached the end, you will be fully armed and dangerous, with all the basic AsterixDB knowledge that you¡¯ll need to start down the path of modeling, storing, and querying your own semistructured data.

ADM: Modeling Semistructed Data in AsterixDB
In this section you will learn all about modeling Big Data using ADM, the data model of the AsterixDB BDMS.

Dataverses, Datatypes, and Datasets
The top-level organizing concept in the AsterixDB world is the dataverse. A dataverse¡ªshort for ¡°data universe¡±¡ªis a place (similar to a database in a relational DBMS) in which to create and manage the types, datasets, functions, and other artifacts for a given AsterixDB application. When you start using an AsterixDB instance for the first time, it starts out ¡°empty¡±; it contains no data other than the AsterixDB system catalogs (which live in a special dataverse called the Metadata dataverse). To store your data in AsterixDB, you will first create a dataverse and then you use it for the datatypes and datasets for managing your own data. A datatype tells AsterixDB what you know (or more accurately, what you want it to know) a priori about one of the kinds of data instances that you want AsterixDB to hold for you. A dataset is a collection of data instances of a datatype, and AsterixDB makes sure that the data instances that you put in it conform to its specified type. Since AsterixDB targets semistructured data, you can use open datatypes and tell it as little or as much as you wish about your data up front; the more you tell it up front, the less information it will have to store repeatedly in the individual data instances that you give it. Instances of open datatypes are permitted to have additional content, beyond what the datatype says, as long as they at least contain the information prescribed by the datatype definition. Open typing allows data to vary from one instance to another and it leaves wiggle room for application evolution in terms of what might need to be stored in the future. If you want to restrict data instances in a dataset to have only what the datatype says, and nothing extra, you can define a closed datatype for that dataset and AsterixDB will keep users from storing objects that have extra data in them. Datatypes are open by default unless you tell AsterixDB otherwise. Let¡¯s put these concepts to work
Our little sample scenario involves hypothetical information about users of two popular social networks, Facebook and Twitter, and their messages. We¡¯ll start by defining a dataverse called ¡°TinySocial¡± to hold our datatypes and datasets. The AsterixDB data model (ADM) is essentially a superset of JSON¡ªit¡¯s what you get by extending JSON with more data types and additional data modeling constructs borrowed from object databases. The following is how we can create the TinySocial dataverse plus a set of ADM types for modeling Twitter users, their Tweets, Facebook users, their users¡¯ employment information, and their messages. (Note: Keep in mind that this is just a tiny and somewhat silly example intended for illustrating some of the key features of AsterixDB. :-))


    drop dataverse TinySocial if exists;
    create dataverse TinySocial;
    use dataverse TinySocial;

    create type TwitterUserType as open {
        screen-name: string,
        lang: string,
        friends_count: int32,
        statuses_count: int32,
        name: string,
        followers_count: int32
    }

    create type TweetMessageType as closed {
        tweetid: string,
        user: TwitterUserType,
        sender-location: point?,
        send-time: datetime,
        referred-topics: {{ string }},
        message-text: string
    }

    create type EmploymentType as open {
        organization-name: string,
        start-date: date,
        end-date: date?
    }

    create type FacebookUserType as closed {
        id: int32,
        alias: string,
        name: string,
        user-since: datetime,
        friend-ids: {{ int32 }},
        employment: [EmploymentType]
    }

    create type FacebookMessageType as closed {
        message-id: int32,
        author-id: int32,
        in-response-to: int32?,
        sender-location: point?,
        message: string
    }

The first three lines above tell AsterixDB to drop the old TinySocial dataverse, if one already exists, and then to create a brand new one and make it the focus of the statements that follow. The first type creation statement creates a datatype for holding information about Twitter users. It is a record type with a mix of integer and string data, very much like a (flat) relational tuple. The indicated fields are all mandatory, but because the type is open, additional fields are welcome. The second statement creates a datatype for Twitter messages; this shows how to specify a closed type. Interestingly (based on one of Twitter¡¯s APIs), each Twitter message actually embeds an instance of the sending user¡¯s information (current as of when the message was sent), so this is an example of a nested record in ADM. Twitter messages can optionally contain the sender¡¯s location, which is modeled via the sender-location field of spatial type point; the question mark following the field type indicates its optionality. An optional field is like a nullable field in SQL¡ªit may be present or missing, but when it¡¯s present, its data type will conform to the datatype¡¯s specification. The send-time field illustrates the use of a temporal primitive type, datetime. Lastly, the referred-topics field illustrates another way that ADM is richer than the relational model; this field holds a bag (a.k.a. an unordered list) of strings. Since the overall datatype definition for Twitter messages says ¡°closed¡±, the fields that it lists are the only fields that instances of this type will be allowed to contain. The next two create type statements create a record type for holding information about one component of the employment history of a Facebook user and then a record type for holding the user information itself. The Facebook user type highlights a few additional ADM data model features. Its friend-ids field is a bag of integers, presumably the Facebook user ids for this user¡¯s friends, and its employment field is an ordered list of employment records. The final create type statement defines a type for handling the content of a Facebook message in our hypothetical social data storage scenario.
Before going on, we need to once again emphasize the idea that AsterixDB is aimed at storing and querying not just Big Data, but Big Semistructured Data. This means that most of the fields listed in the create type statements above could have been omitted without changing anything other than the resulting size of stored data instances on disk. AsterixDB stores its information about the fields defined a priori as separate metadata, whereas the information about other fields that are ¡°just there¡± in instances of open datatypes is stored with each instance¡ªmaking for more bits on disk and longer times for operations affected by data size (e.g., dataset scans). The only fields that must be specified a priori are the primary key and any fields that you would like to build indexes on. (AsterixDB does not yet support auto-generated keys or indexes on the unspecified ¡°open¡± fields of its data instances).

Creating Datasets and Indexes
Now that we have defined our datatypes, we can move on and create datasets to store the actual data. (If we wanted to, we could even have several named datasets based on any one of these datatypes.) We can do this as follows, utilizing the DDL capabilities of AsterixDB.


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    create dataset FacebookUsers(FacebookUserType)
    primary key id;

    create dataset FacebookMessages(FacebookMessageType)
    primary key message-id;

    create dataset TwitterUsers(TwitterUserType)
    primary key screen-name;

    create dataset TweetMessages(TweetMessageType)
    primary key tweetid
    hints(cardinality=100);

    create index fbUserSinceIdx on FacebookUsers(user-since);
    create index fbAuthorIdx on FacebookMessages(author-id) type btree;
    create index fbSenderLocIndex on FacebookMessages(sender-location) type rtree;
    create index fbMessageIdx on FacebookMessages(message) type keyword;

    for $ds in dataset Metadata.Dataset return $ds;
    for $ix in dataset Metadata.Index return $ix;

The ADM DDL statements above create four datasets for holding our social data in the TinySocial dataverse: FacebookUsers, FacebookMessages, TwitterUsers, and TweetMessages. The first statement creates the FacebookUsers data set. It specifies that this dataset will store data instances conforming to FacebookUserType and that it has a primary key which is the id field of each instance. The primary key information is used by AsterixDB to uniquely identify instances for the purpose of later lookup and for use in secondary indexes. Each AsterixDB dataset is stored (and indexed) in the form of a B+ tree on primary key; secondary indexes point to their indexed data by primary key. In AsterixDB clusters, the primary key is also used to hash-partition (a.k.a. shard) the dataset across the nodes of the cluster. The next three create dataset statements are similar. The last one illustrates an optional clause for providing useful hints to AsterixDB. In this case, the hint tells AsterixDB that the dataset definer is anticipating that the TweetMessages dataset will contain roughly 100 objects; knowing this can help AsterixDB to more efficiently manage and query this dataset. (AsterixDB does not yet gather and maintain data statistics; it will currently, abitrarily, assume a cardinality of one million objects per dataset in the absence of such an optional definition-time hint.)
The create dataset statements above are followed by four more DDL statements, each of which creates a secondary index on a field of one of the datasets. The first one indexes the FacebookUsers dataset on its user-since field. This index will be a B+ tree index; its type is unspecified and btree is the default type. The other three illustrate how you can explicitly specify the desired type of index. In addition to btree, rtree and inverted keyword indexes are supported by AsterixDB. Indexes can also have composite keys, and more advanced text indexing is available as well (ngram(k), where k is the desired gram length).

Querying the Metadata Dataverse
The last two statements above show how you can use queries in AQL to examine the AsterixDB system catalogs and tell what artifacts you have created. Just as relational DBMSs use their own tables to store their catalogs, AsterixDB uses its own datasets to persist descriptions of its datasets, datatypes, indexes, and so on. Running the first of the two queries above will list all of your newly created datasets, and it will also show you a full list of all the metadata datasets. (You can then explore from there on your own if you are curious) These last two queries also illustrate one other factoid worth knowing: AsterixDB allows queries to span dataverses by allowing the optional use of fully-qualified dataset names (i.e., dataversename.datasetname) to reference datasets that live in a dataverse other than the one that was named in the most recently executed use dataverse directive.

Loading Data Into AsterixDB
Okay, so far so good¡ªAsterixDB is now ready for data, so let¡¯s give it some data to store Our next task will be to load some sample data into the four datasets that we just defined. Here we will load a tiny set of records, defined in ADM format (a superset of JSON), into each dataset. In the boxes below you can see the actual data instances contained in each of the provided sample files. In order to load this data yourself, you should first store the four corresponding .adm files (whose URLs are indicated on top of each box below) into a filesystem directory accessible to your running AsterixDB instance. Take a few minutes to look carefully at each of the sample data sets. This will give you a better sense of the nature of the data that we are about to load and query. We should note that ADM format is a textual serialization of what AsterixDB will actually store; when persisted in AsterixDB, the data format will be binary and the data in the predefined fields of the data instances will be stored separately from their associated field name and type metadata.

It¡¯s loading time! We can use AQL load statements to populate our datasets with the sample records shown above. The following shows how loading can be done for data stored in .adm files in your local filesystem. Note: You MUST replace the <Host Name> and <Absolute File Path> placeholders in each load statement below with valid values based on the host IP address (or host name) for the machine and directory that you have downloaded the provided .adm files to. As you do so, be very, very careful to retain the two slashes in the load statements, i.e., do not delete the two slashes that appear in front of the absolute path to your .adm files. (This will lead to a three-slash character sequence at the start of each load statement¡¯s file input path specification.)


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    load dataset FacebookUsers using localfs
    (("path"="<Host Name>://<Absolute File Path>/fbu.adm"),("format"="adm"));

    load dataset FacebookMessages using localfs
    (("path"="<Host Name>://<Absolute File Path>/fbm.adm"),("format"="adm"));

    load dataset TwitterUsers using localfs
    (("path"="<Host Name>://<Absolute File Path>/twu.adm"),("format"="adm"));

    load dataset TweetMessages using localfs
    (("path"="<Host Name>://<Absolute File Path>/twm.adm"),("format"="adm"));

AQL: Querying Your AsterixDB Data
Congratulations! You now have sample social data stored (and indexed) in AsterixDB. (You are part of an elite and adventurous group of individuals. :-)) Now that you have successfully loaded the provided sample data into the datasets that we defined, you can start running queries against them.
The query language for AsterixDB is AQL¡ªthe Asterix Query Language. AQL is loosely based on XQuery, the language developed and standardized in the early to mid 2000¡¯s by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for querying semistructured data stored in their XML format. We have tossed all of the ¡°XML cruft¡± out of their language but retained many of its core ideas. We did this because its design was developed over a period of years by a diverse committee of smart and experienced language designers, including ¡°SQL people¡±, ¡°functional programming people¡±, and ¡°XML people¡±, all of whom were focused on how to design a new query language that operates well over semistructured data. (We decided to stand on their shoulders instead of starting from scratch and revisiting many of the same issues.) Note that AQL is not SQL and not based on SQL: In other words, AsterixDB is fully ¡°NoSQL compliant¡±. :-)
In this section we introduce AQL via a set of example queries, along with their expected results, based on the data above, to help you get started. Many of the most important features of AQL are presented in this set of representative queries. You can find more details in the document on the Asterix Data Model (ADM), in the AQL Reference Manual, and a complete list of built-in functions is available in the Asterix Functions document.
AQL is an expression language. Even the expression 1+1 is a valid AQL query that evaluates to 2. (Try it for yourself! Okay, maybe that¡¯s not the best use of a 512-node shared-nothing compute cluster.) Most useful AQL queries will be based on the FLWOR (pronounced ¡°flower¡±) expression structure that AQL has borrowed from XQuery ((http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLWOR)). The FLWOR expression syntax supports both the incremental binding (for) of variables to ADM data instances in a dataset (or in the result of any AQL expression, actually) and the full binding (let) of variables to entire intermediate results in a fashion similar to temporary views in the SQL world. FLWOR is an acronym that is short for for-let-where-order by-return, naming five of the most frequently used clauses from the syntax of a full AQL query. AQL also includes group by and limit clauses, as you will see shortly. Roughly speaking, for SQL afficiandos, the for clause in AQL is like the from clause in SQL, the return clause in AQL is like the select clause in SQL (but appears at the end instead of the beginning of a query), the let clause in AQL is like SQL¡¯s with clause, and the where and order by clauses in both languages are similar.
Enough talk! Let¡¯s go ahead and try writing some queries and see about learning AQL by example.

Query 0-A - Exact-Match Lookup
For our first query, let¡¯s find a Facebook user based on his or her user id. Suppose the user we want is the user whose id is 8:


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    for $user in dataset FacebookUsers
    where $user.id = 8
    return $user;

The query¡¯s for clause binds the variable $user incrementally to the data instances residing in the dataset named FacebookUsers. Its where clause selects only those bindings having a user id of interest, filtering out the rest. The return clause returns the (entire) data instance for each binding that satisfies the predicate. Since this dataset is indexed on user id (its primary key), this query will be done via a quick index lookup.
The expected result for our sample data is as follows:


    { "id": 8, "alias": "Nila", "name": "NilaMilliron", "user-since": datetime("2008-01-01T10:10:00.000Z"), "friend-ids": {{ 3 }}, "employment": [ { "organization-name": "Plexlane", "start-date": date("2010-02-28"), "end-date": null } ] }


Query 0-B - Range Scan
AQL, like SQL, supports a variety of different predicates. For example, for our next query, let¡¯s find the Facebook users whose ids are in the range between 2 and 4:


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    for $user in dataset FacebookUsers
    where $user.id >= 2 and $user.id <= 4
    return $user;

This query¡¯s expected result, also evaluable using the primary index on user id, is:


    { "id": 2, "alias": "Isbel", "name": "IsbelDull", "user-since": datetime("2011-01-22T10:10:00.000Z"), "friend-ids": {{ 1, 4 }}, "employment": [ { "organization-name": "Hexviafind", "start-date": date("2010-04-27"), "end-date": null } ] }
    { "id": 3, "alias": "Emory", "name": "EmoryUnk", "user-since": datetime("2012-07-10T10:10:00.000Z"), "friend-ids": {{ 1, 5, 8, 9 }}, "employment": [ { "organization-name": "geomedia", "start-date": date("2010-06-17"), "end-date": date("2010-01-26") } ] }
    { "id": 4, "alias": "Nicholas", "name": "NicholasStroh", "user-since": datetime("2010-12-27T10:10:00.000Z"), "friend-ids": {{ 2 }}, "employment": [ { "organization-name": "Zamcorporation", "start-date": date("2010-06-08"), "end-date": null } ] }


Query 1 - Other Query Filters
AQL can do range queries on any data type that supports the appropriate set of comparators. As an example, this next query retrieves the Facebook users who joined between July 22, 2010 and July 29, 2012:


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    for $user in dataset FacebookUsers
    where $user.user-since >= datetime('2010-07-22T00:00:00')
      and $user.user-since <= datetime('2012-07-29T23:59:59')
    return $user;

The expected result for this query, also an indexable query, is as follows:


    { "id": 2, "alias": "Isbel", "name": "IsbelDull", "user-since": datetime("2011-01-22T10:10:00.000Z"), "friend-ids": {{ 1, 4 }}, "employment": [ { "organization-name": "Hexviafind", "start-date": date("2010-04-27"), "end-date": null } ] }
    { "id": 3, "alias": "Emory", "name": "EmoryUnk", "user-since": datetime("2012-07-10T10:10:00.000Z"), "friend-ids": {{ 1, 5, 8, 9 }}, "employment": [ { "organization-name": "geomedia", "start-date": date("2010-06-17"), "end-date": date("2010-01-26") } ] }
    { "id": 4, "alias": "Nicholas", "name": "NicholasStroh", "user-since": datetime("2010-12-27T10:10:00.000Z"), "friend-ids": {{ 2 }}, "employment": [ { "organization-name": "Zamcorporation", "start-date": date("2010-06-08"), "end-date": null } ] }
    { "id": 10, "alias": "Bram", "name": "BramHatch", "user-since": datetime("2010-10-16T10:10:00.000Z"), "friend-ids": {{ 1, 5, 9 }}, "employment": [ { "organization-name": "physcane", "start-date": date("2007-06-05"), "end-date": date("2011-11-05") } ] }


Query 2-A - Equijoin
In addition to simply binding variables to data instances and returning them ¡°whole¡±, an AQL query can construct new ADM instances to return based on combinations of its variable bindings. This gives AQL the power to do joins much like those done using multi-table from clauses in SQL. For example, suppose we wanted a list of all Facebook users paired with their associated messages, with the list enumerating the author name and the message text associated with each Facebook message. We could do this as follows in AQL:


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    for $user in dataset FacebookUsers
    for $message in dataset FacebookMessages
    where $message.author-id = $user.id
    return {
    "uname": $user.name,
    "message": $message.message
    };

The result of this query is a sequence of new ADM instances, one for each author/message pair. Each instance in the result will be an ADM record containing two fields, ¡°uname¡± and ¡°message¡±, containing the user¡¯s name and the message text, respectively, for each author/message pair. (Note that ¡°uname¡± and ¡°message¡± are both simple AQL expressions themselves¡ªso in the most general case, even the resulting field names can be computed as part of the query, making AQL a very powerful tool for slicing and dicing semistructured data.)
The expected result of this example AQL join query for our sample data set is:


    { "uname": "MargaritaStoddard", "message": " dislike iphone its touch-screen is horrible" }
    { "uname": "MargaritaStoddard", "message": " can't stand at&t the network is horrible:(" }
    { "uname": "MargaritaStoddard", "message": " like verizon the 3G is awesome:)" }
    { "uname": "MargaritaStoddard", "message": " can't stand motorola the touch-screen is terrible" }
    { "uname": "MargaritaStoddard", "message": " can't stand at&t its plan is terrible" }
    { "uname": "IsbelDull", "message": " like samsung the plan is amazing" }
    { "uname": "IsbelDull", "message": " like t-mobile its platform is mind-blowing" }
    { "uname": "EmoryUnk", "message": " love sprint its shortcut-menu is awesome:)" }
    { "uname": "EmoryUnk", "message": " love verizon its wireless is good" }
    { "uname": "VonKemble", "message": " dislike sprint the speed is horrible" }
    { "uname": "WillisWynne", "message": " love sprint the customization is mind-blowing" }
    { "uname": "SuzannaTillson", "message": " like iphone the voicemail-service is awesome" }
    { "uname": "WoodrowNehling", "message": " love at&t its 3G is good:)" }
    { "uname": "BramHatch", "message": " can't stand t-mobile its voicemail-service is OMG:(" }
    { "uname": "BramHatch", "message": " dislike iphone the voice-command is bad:(" }


Query 2-B - Index join
By default, AsterixDB evaluates equijoin queries using hash-based join methods that work well for doing ad hoc joins of very large data sets (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_join). On a cluster, hash partitioning is employed as AsterixDB¡¯s divide-and-conquer strategy for computing large parallel joins. AsterixDB includes other join methods, but in the absence of data statistics and selectivity estimates, it doesn¡¯t (yet) have the know-how to intelligently choose among its alternatives. We therefore asked ourselves the classic question¡ªWWOD?¡ªWhat Would Oracle Do?¡ªand in the interim, AQL includes a clunky (but useful) hint-based mechanism for addressing the occasional need to suggest to AsterixDB which join method it should use for a particular AQL query.
The following query is similar to Query 2-A but includes a suggestion to AsterixDB that it should consider employing an index-based nested-loop join technique to process the query:


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    for $user in dataset FacebookUsers
    for $message in dataset FacebookMessages
    where $message.author-id /*+ indexnl */  = $user.id
    return {
    "uname": $user.name,
    "message": $message.message
    };

The expected result is (of course) the same as before, modulo the order of the instances. Result ordering is (intentionally) undefined in AQL in the absence of an order by clause. The query result for our sample data in this case is:


    { "uname": "EmoryUnk", "message": " love sprint its shortcut-menu is awesome:)" }
    { "uname": "MargaritaStoddard", "message": " dislike iphone its touch-screen is horrible" }
    { "uname": "IsbelDull", "message": " like samsung the plan is amazing" }
    { "uname": "MargaritaStoddard", "message": " can't stand at&t the network is horrible:(" }
    { "uname": "WillisWynne", "message": " love sprint the customization is mind-blowing" }
    { "uname": "IsbelDull", "message": " like t-mobile its platform is mind-blowing" }
    { "uname": "VonKemble", "message": " dislike sprint the speed is horrible" }
    { "uname": "MargaritaStoddard", "message": " like verizon the 3G is awesome:)" }
    { "uname": "EmoryUnk", "message": " love verizon its wireless is good" }
    { "uname": "MargaritaStoddard", "message": " can't stand motorola the touch-screen is terrible" }
    { "uname": "MargaritaStoddard", "message": " can't stand at&t its plan is terrible" }
    { "uname": "BramHatch", "message": " can't stand t-mobile its voicemail-service is OMG:(" }
    { "uname": "BramHatch", "message": " dislike iphone the voice-command is bad:(" }
    { "uname": "WoodrowNehling", "message": " love at&t its 3G is good:)" }
    { "uname": "SuzannaTillson", "message": " like iphone the voicemail-service is awesome" }

(It is worth knowing, with respect to influencing AsterixDB¡¯s query evaluation, that nested for clauses¡ªa.k.a. joins¡ª are currently evaluated with the ¡°outer¡± clause probing the data of the ¡°inner¡± clause.)

Query 3 - Nested Outer Join
In order to support joins between tables with missing/dangling join tuples, the designers of SQL ended up shoe-horning a subset of the relational algebra into SQL¡¯s from clause syntax¡ªand providing a variety of join types there for users to choose from. Left outer joins are particularly important in SQL, e.g., to print a summary of customers and orders, grouped by customer, without omitting those customers who haven¡¯t placed any orders yet.
The AQL language supports nesting, both of queries and of query results, and the combination allows for an arguably cleaner/more natural approach to such queries. As an example, supposed we wanted, for each Facebook user, to produce a record that has his/her name plus a list of the messages written by that user. In SQL, this would involve a left outer join between users and messages, grouping by user, and having the user name repeated along side each message. In AQL, this sort of use case can be handled (more naturally) as follows:


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    for $user in dataset FacebookUsers
    return {
    "uname": $user.name,
    "messages": for $message in dataset FacebookMessages
           where $message.author-id = $user.id
           return $message.message
    };

This AQL query binds the variable $user to the data instances in FacebookUsers; for each user, it constructs a result record containing a ¡°uname¡± field with the user¡¯s name and a ¡°messages¡± field with a nested collection of all messages for that user. The nested collection for each user is specified by using a correlated subquery. (Note: While it looks like nested loops could be involved in computing the result, AsterixDB recogizes the equivalence of such a query to an outerjoin, and it will use an efficient hash-based strategy when actually computing the query¡¯s result.)
Here is this example query¡¯s expected output:


    { "uname": "MargaritaStoddard", "messages": [ " dislike iphone its touch-screen is horrible", " can't stand at&t the network is horrible:(", " like verizon the 3G is awesome:)", " can't stand motorola the touch-screen is terrible", " can't stand at&t its plan is terrible" ] }
    { "uname": "IsbelDull", "messages": [ " like samsung the plan is amazing", " like t-mobile its platform is mind-blowing" ] }
    { "uname": "EmoryUnk", "messages": [ " love sprint its shortcut-menu is awesome:)", " love verizon its wireless is good" ] }
    { "uname": "NicholasStroh", "messages": [  ] }
    { "uname": "VonKemble", "messages": [ " dislike sprint the speed is horrible" ] }
    { "uname": "WillisWynne", "messages": [ " love sprint the customization is mind-blowing" ] }
    { "uname": "SuzannaTillson", "messages": [ " like iphone the voicemail-service is awesome" ] }
    { "uname": "NilaMilliron", "messages": [  ] }
    { "uname": "WoodrowNehling", "messages": [ " love at&t its 3G is good:)" ] }
    { "uname": "BramHatch", "messages": [ " dislike iphone the voice-command is bad:(", " can't stand t-mobile its voicemail-service is OMG:(" ] }


Query 4 - Theta Join
Not all joins are expressible as equijoins and computable using equijoin-oriented algorithms. The join predicates for some use cases involve predicates with functions; AsterixDB supports the expression of such queries and will still evaluate them as best it can using nested loop based techniques (and broadcast joins in the parallel case).
As an example of such a use case, suppose that we wanted, for each tweet T, to find all of the other tweets that originated from within a circle of radius of 1 surrounding tweet T¡¯s location. In AQL, this can be specified in a manner similar to the previous query using one of the built-in functions on the spatial data type instead of id equality in the correlated query¡¯s where clause:


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    for $t in dataset TweetMessages
    return {
    "message": $t.message-text,
    "nearby-messages": for $t2 in dataset TweetMessages
             where spatial-distance($t.sender-location, $t2.sender-location) <= 1
             return { "msgtxt":$t2.message-text}
    };

Here is the expected result for this query:


    { "message": " love t-mobile its customization is good:)", "nearby-messages": [ { "msgtxt": " love t-mobile its customization is good:)" } ] }
    { "message": " hate verizon its voice-clarity is OMG:(", "nearby-messages": [ { "msgtxt": " like motorola the speed is good:)" }, { "msgtxt": " hate verizon its voice-clarity is OMG:(" } ] }
    { "message": " can't stand iphone its platform is terrible", "nearby-messages": [ { "msgtxt": " can't stand iphone its platform is terrible" } ] }
    { "message": " like samsung the voice-command is amazing:)", "nearby-messages": [ { "msgtxt": " like samsung the voice-command is amazing:)" } ] }
    { "message": " like verizon its shortcut-menu is awesome:)", "nearby-messages": [ { "msgtxt": " like verizon its shortcut-menu is awesome:)" } ] }
    { "message": " like motorola the speed is good:)", "nearby-messages": [ { "msgtxt": " hate verizon its voice-clarity is OMG:(" }, { "msgtxt": " like motorola the speed is good:)" } ] }
    { "message": " like sprint the voice-command is mind-blowing:)", "nearby-messages": [ { "msgtxt": " like sprint the voice-command is mind-blowing:)" } ] }
    { "message": " can't stand motorola its speed is terrible:(", "nearby-messages": [ { "msgtxt": " can't stand motorola its speed is terrible:(" } ] }
    { "message": " like iphone the voice-clarity is good:)", "nearby-messages": [ { "msgtxt": " like iphone the voice-clarity is good:)" } ] }
    { "message": " like samsung the platform is good", "nearby-messages": [ { "msgtxt": " like samsung the platform is good" } ] }
    { "message": " like t-mobile the shortcut-menu is awesome:)", "nearby-messages": [ { "msgtxt": " like t-mobile the shortcut-menu is awesome:)" } ] }
    { "message": " love verizon its voicemail-service is awesome", "nearby-messages": [ { "msgtxt": " love verizon its voicemail-service is awesome" } ] }


Query 5 - Fuzzy Join
As another example of a non-equijoin use case, we could ask AsterixDB to find, for each Facebook user, all Twitter users with names ¡°similar¡± to their name. AsterixDB supports a variety of ¡°fuzzy match¡± functions for use with textual and set-based data. As one example, we could choose to use edit distance with a threshold of 3 as the definition of name similarity, in which case we could write the following query using AQL¡¯s operator-based syntax (~=) for testing whether or not two values are similar:


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    set simfunction "edit-distance";
    set simthreshold "3";

    for $fbu in dataset FacebookUsers
    return {
        "id": $fbu.id,
        "name": $fbu.name,
        "similar-users": for $t in dataset TweetMessages
             let $tu := $t.user
             where $tu.name ~= $fbu.name
             return {
             "twitter-screenname": $tu.screen-name,
             "twitter-name": $tu.name
             }
    };

The expected result for this query against our sample data is:


    { "id": 1, "name": "MargaritaStoddard", "similar-users": [  ] }
    { "id": 2, "name": "IsbelDull", "similar-users": [  ] }
    { "id": 3, "name": "EmoryUnk", "similar-users": [  ] }
    { "id": 4, "name": "NicholasStroh", "similar-users": [  ] }
    { "id": 5, "name": "VonKemble", "similar-users": [  ] }
    { "id": 6, "name": "WillisWynne", "similar-users": [  ] }
    { "id": 7, "name": "SuzannaTillson", "similar-users": [  ] }
    { "id": 8, "name": "NilaMilliron", "similar-users": [ { "twitter-screenname": "NilaMilliron_tw", "twitter-name": "Nila Milliron" } ] }
    { "id": 9, "name": "WoodrowNehling", "similar-users": [  ] }
    { "id": 10, "name": "BramHatch", "similar-users": [  ] }


Query 6 - Existential Quantification
The expressive power of AQL includes support for queries involving ¡°some¡± (existentially quantified) and ¡°all¡± (universally quantified) query semantics. As an example of an existential AQL query, here we show a query to list the Facebook users who are currently employed. Such employees will have an employment history containing a record with a null end-date value, which leads us to the following AQL query:


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    for $fbu in dataset FacebookUsers
    where (some $e in $fbu.employment satisfies is-null($e.end-date))
    return $fbu;

The expected result in this case is:


    { "id": 1, "alias": "Margarita", "name": "MargaritaStoddard", "user-since": datetime("2012-08-20T10:10:00.000Z"), "friend-ids": {{ 2, 3, 6, 10 }}, "employment": [ { "organization-name": "Codetechno", "start-date": date("2006-08-06"), "end-date": null } ] }
    { "id": 2, "alias": "Isbel", "name": "IsbelDull", "user-since": datetime("2011-01-22T10:10:00.000Z"), "friend-ids": {{ 1, 4 }}, "employment": [ { "organization-name": "Hexviafind", "start-date": date("2010-04-27"), "end-date": null } ] }
    { "id": 4, "alias": "Nicholas", "name": "NicholasStroh", "user-since": datetime("2010-12-27T10:10:00.000Z"), "friend-ids": {{ 2 }}, "employment": [ { "organization-name": "Zamcorporation", "start-date": date("2010-06-08"), "end-date": null } ] }
    { "id": 5, "alias": "Von", "name": "VonKemble", "user-since": datetime("2010-01-05T10:10:00.000Z"), "friend-ids": {{ 3, 6, 10 }}, "employment": [ { "organization-name": "Kongreen", "start-date": date("2010-11-27"), "end-date": null } ] }
    { "id": 6, "alias": "Willis", "name": "WillisWynne", "user-since": datetime("2005-01-17T10:10:00.000Z"), "friend-ids": {{ 1, 3, 7 }}, "employment": [ { "organization-name": "jaydax", "start-date": date("2009-05-15"), "end-date": null } ] }
    { "id": 7, "alias": "Suzanna", "name": "SuzannaTillson", "user-since": datetime("2012-08-07T10:10:00.000Z"), "friend-ids": {{ 6 }}, "employment": [ { "organization-name": "Labzatron", "start-date": date("2011-04-19"), "end-date": null } ] }
    { "id": 8, "alias": "Nila", "name": "NilaMilliron", "user-since": datetime("2008-01-01T10:10:00.000Z"), "friend-ids": {{ 3 }}, "employment": [ { "organization-name": "Plexlane", "start-date": date("2010-02-28"), "end-date": null } ] }


Query 7 - Universal Quantification
As an example of a universal AQL query, here we show a query to list the Facebook users who are currently unemployed. Such employees will have an employment history containing no records with null end-date values, leading us to the following AQL query:


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    for $fbu in dataset FacebookUsers
    where (every $e in $fbu.employment satisfies not(is-null($e.end-date)))
    return $fbu;

Here is the expected result for our sample data:


    { "id": 3, "alias": "Emory", "name": "EmoryUnk", "user-since": datetime("2012-07-10T10:10:00.000Z"), "friend-ids": {{ 1, 5, 8, 9 }}, "employment": [ { "organization-name": "geomedia", "start-date": date("2010-06-17"), "end-date": date("2010-01-26") } ] }
    { "id": 9, "alias": "Woodrow", "name": "WoodrowNehling", "user-since": datetime("2005-09-20T10:10:00.000Z"), "friend-ids": {{ 3, 10 }}, "employment": [ { "organization-name": "Zuncan", "start-date": date("2003-04-22"), "end-date": date("2009-12-13") } ] }
    { "id": 10, "alias": "Bram", "name": "BramHatch", "user-since": datetime("2010-10-16T10:10:00.000Z"), "friend-ids": {{ 1, 5, 9 }}, "employment": [ { "organization-name": "physcane", "start-date": date("2007-06-05"), "end-date": date("2011-11-05") } ] }


Query 8 - Simple Aggregation
Like SQL, the AQL language of AsterixDB provides support for computing aggregates over large amounts of data. As a very simple example, the following AQL query computes the total number of Facebook users:


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    count(for $fbu in dataset FacebookUsers return $fbu);

In AQL, aggregate functions can be applied to arbitrary subquery results; in this case, the count function is applied to the result of a query that enumerates the Facebook users. The expected result here is:


    10


Query 9-A - Grouping and Aggregation
Also like SQL, AQL supports grouped aggregation. For every Twitter user, the following group-by/aggregate query counts the number of tweets sent by that user:


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    for $t in dataset TweetMessages
    group by $uid := $t.user.screen-name with $t
    return {
    "user": $uid,
    "count": count($t)
    };

The for clause incrementally binds $t to tweets, and the group by clause groups the tweets by its issuer¡¯s Twitter screen-name. Unlike SQL, where data is tabular¡ªflat¡ªthe data model underlying AQL allows for nesting. Thus, following the group by clause, the return clause in this query sees a sequence of $t groups, with each such group having an associated $uid variable value (i.e., the tweeting user¡¯s screen name). In the context of the return clause, due to ¡°¡­ with $t ¡­¡±, $uid is bound to the tweeter¡¯s id and $t is bound to the set of tweets issued by that tweeter. The return clause constructs a result record containing the tweeter¡¯s user id and the count of the items in the associated tweet set. The query result will contain one such record per screen name. This query also illustrates another feature of AQL; notice that each user¡¯s screen name is accessed via a path syntax that traverses each tweet¡¯s nested record structure.
Here is the expected result for this query over the sample data:


    { "user": "ChangEwing_573", "count": 1 }
    { "user": "ColineGeyer@63", "count": 3 }
    { "user": "NathanGiesen@211", "count": 6 }
    { "user": "NilaMilliron_tw", "count": 1 }
    { "user": "OliJackson_512", "count": 1 }


Query 9-B - (Hash-Based) Grouping and Aggregation
As for joins, AsterixDB has multiple evaluation strategies available for processing grouped aggregate queries. For grouped aggregation, the system knows how to employ both sort-based and hash-based aggregation methods, with sort-based methods being used by default and a hint being available to suggest that a different approach be used in processing a particular AQL query.
The following query is similar to Query 9-A, but adds a hash-based aggregation hint:


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    for $t in dataset TweetMessages
    /*+ hash*/
    group by $uid := $t.user.screen-name with $t
    return {
    "user": $uid,
    "count": count($t)
    };

Here is the expected result:


    { "user": "OliJackson_512", "count": 1 }
    { "user": "ColineGeyer@63", "count": 3 }
    { "user": "NathanGiesen@211", "count": 6 }
    { "user": "NilaMilliron_tw", "count": 1 }
    { "user": "ChangEwing_573", "count": 1 }


Query 10 - Grouping and Limits
In some use cases it is not necessary to compute the entire answer to a query. In some cases, just having the first N or top N results is sufficient. This is expressible in AQL using the limit clause combined with the order by clause.
The following AQL query returns the top 3 Twitter users based on who has issued the most tweets:


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    for $t in dataset TweetMessages
    group by $uid := $t.user.screen-name with $t
    let $c := count($t)
    order by $c desc
    limit 3
    return {
        "user": $uid,
        "count": $c
    };

The expected result for this query is:


    { "user": "NathanGiesen@211", "count": 6 }
    { "user": "ColineGeyer@63", "count": 3 }
    { "user": "NilaMilliron_tw", "count": 1 }


Query 11 - Left Outer Fuzzy Join
As a last example of AQL and its query power, the following query, for each tweet, finds all of the tweets that are similar based on the topics that they refer to:


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    set simfunction "jaccard";
    set simthreshold "0.3";

    for $t in dataset TweetMessages
    return {
        "tweet": $t,
        "similar-tweets": for $t2 in dataset TweetMessages
             where  $t2.referred-topics ~= $t.referred-topics
             and $t2.tweetid != $t.tweetid
             return $t2.referred-topics
    };

This query illustrates several things worth knowing in order to write fuzzy queries in AQL. First, as mentioned earlier, AQL offers an operator-based syntax for seeing whether two values are ¡°similar¡± to one another or not. Second, recall that the referred-topics field of records of datatype TweetMessageType is a bag of strings. This query sets the context for its similarity join by requesting that Jaccard-based similarity semantics (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) be used for the query¡¯s similarity operator and that a similarity index of 0.3 be used as its similarity threshold.
The expected result for this fuzzy join query is:


    { "tweet": { "tweetid": "1", "user": { "screen-name": "NathanGiesen@211", "lang": "en", "friends_count": 39339, "statuses_count": 473, "name": "Nathan Giesen", "followers_count": 49416 }, "sender-location": point("47.44,80.65"), "send-time": datetime("2008-04-26T10:10:00.000Z"), "referred-topics": {{ "t-mobile", "customization" }}, "message-text": " love t-mobile its customization is good:)" }, "similar-tweets": [ {{ "t-mobile", "shortcut-menu" }} ] }

Inserting New Data
In addition to loading and querying data, AsterixDB supports incremental additions to datasets via the AQL insert statement.
The following example adds a new tweet by user ¡°NathanGiesen@211¡± to the TweetMessages dataset. (An astute reader may notice that this tweet was issued a half an hour after his last tweet, so his counts have all gone up in the interim, although he appears not to have moved in the last half hour.)


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    insert into dataset TweetMessages
    (
       {"tweetid":"13",
        "user":
            {"screen-name":"NathanGiesen@211",
             "lang":"en",
             "friends_count":39345,
             "statuses_count":479,
             "name":"Nathan Giesen",
             "followers_count":49420
            },
        "sender-location":point("47.44,80.65"),
        "send-time":datetime("2008-04-26T10:10:35"),
        "referred-topics":{{"tweeting"}},
        "message-text":"tweety tweet, my fellow tweeters!"
       }
    );

In general, the data to be inserted may be specified using any valid AQL query expression. The insertion of a single object instance, as in this example, is just a special case where the query expression happens to be a record constructor involving only constants.

Deleting Existing Data
In addition to inserting new data, AsterixDB supports deletion from datasets via the AQL delete statement. The statement supports ¡°searched delete¡± semantics, and its where clause can involve any valid XQuery expression.
The following example deletes the tweet that we just added from user "NathanGiesen@211". (Easy come, easy go. :-))


    use dataverse TinySocial;

    delete $tm from dataset TweetMessages where $tm.tweetid = "13";

It should be noted that one form of data change not yet supported by AsterixDB is in-place data modification (update). Currently, only insert and delete operations are supported; update is not. To achieve the effect of an update, two statements are currently needed¡ªone to delete the old record from the dataset where it resides, and another to insert the new replacement record (with the same primary key but with different field values for some of the associated data content).

Transaction Support
AsterixDB supports record-level ACID transactions that begin and terminate implicitly for each record inserted, deleted, or searched while a given AQL statement is being executed. This is quite similar to the level of transaction support found in today¡¯s NoSQL stores. AsterixDB does not support multi-statement transactions, and in fact an AQL statement that involves multiple records can itself involve multiple independent record-level transactions. An example consequence of this is that, when an AQL statement attempts to insert 1000 records, it is possible that the first 800 records could end up being committed while the remaining 200 records fail to be inserted. This situation could happen, for example, if a duplicate key exception occurs as the 801st insertion is attempted. If this happens, AsterixDB will report the error (e.g., a duplicate key exception) as the result of the offending AQL insert statement, and the application logic above will need to take the appropriate action(s) needed to assess the resulting state and to clean up and/or continue as appropriate.

Further Help
That¡¯s it You are now armed and dangerous with respect to semistructured data management using AsterixDB.
AsterixDB is a powerful new BDMS¡ªBig Data Management System¡ªthat we hope may usher in a new era of much more declarative Big Data management. AsterixDB is powerful, so use it wisely, and remember: ¡°With great power comes great responsibility¡­¡± :-)
Please e-mail the AsterixDB user group (asterixdb-users (at) googlegroups.com) if you run into any problems or simply have further questions about the AsterixDB system, its features, or their proper use.

}


edit-distance-check


Syntax:
  

edit-distance-check(expression1, expression2, threshold)

Checks whether expression1 and expression2 have an edit distance within a given threshold. The ¡°check¡± version of edit distance is faster than the ¡°non-check¡± version because the former can detect whether two items satisfy a given threshold using early-termination techniques, as opposed to computing their real distance. Although possible, it is not necessary for the user to write queries using the ¡°check¡± versions explicitly, since a rewrite rule can perform an appropriate transformation from a ¡°non-check¡± version to a ¡°check¡± version.
Arguments:
  
expression1 : A string or a homogeneous OrderedList of a comparable item type.expression2 : The same type as expression1.threshold : An int32 that represents the distance threshold.Return Value:
  
An OrderedList with two items:
    
The first item contains a boolean value representing whether expression1 and expression2 are similar.The second item contains an int32 that represents the edit distance of expression1 and expression2 if it is within the threshold, or 0 otherwise.
Example:
  

use dataverse TinySocial;

for $user in dataset('FacebookUsers')

}


similarity-jaccard-check


Syntax:
  

similarity-jaccard-check(list_expression1, list_expression2, threshold)

An OrderedList with two items:The first item contains a boolean value representing whether list_expression1 and list_expression2 are similar.The second item contains a float that represents the Jaccard similarity of list_expression1 and list_expression2 if it is greater than or equal to the threshold, or 0 otherwise.
Example:
  

use dataverse TinySocial;

for $user in dataset('FacebookUsers')
let $sim := similarity-jaccard-check($user.friend-ids, [1,5,9], 0.6f)
where $sim[0]

    Objective

    The goal of this project is to develop techniques to help
      people find their loved ones during or after a disaster.

    Many people can be affected by disasters such as Hurricane
      Katrina. There are many Web sites available during and after a
      disaster, with the same goal of helping people find their loved ones,
      or report they are OK.  For a parent who wants to find online
      information about his missing kid, he needs to go to many such sites
      to search. This process is very time consuming, especially when
      information from the sources keeps changing.

    Another problem is that, a lot of data at the source has
      inconsistencies and even errors. For instance, a kid called
      Michael could be stored as Micheal, since the person who
      submitted the data mistyped the name. A person called William
        Smith could also be stored as Bill Smyth.  The last name of
      a kid could be missing. For these reasons, the parent might not be
      able to find the information, even if the source does include valuable
      information about his missing kid.

    We study these research issues in this project.  As a
      prototype, we crawl and extract information from these Web
      sources, and put the data into a central repository. We also
      provide interfaces for people to submit information about
      missing people, or report they are OK. We allow users to search
      for information in the repository, instead of going to those
      individual sources.

    Due to the low quality of the data, it is very important for
      the system to allow users to find persons whose description
      matches a search query approximately. We are developing research
      techniques to answer such search queries efficiently.  In
      addition, we also need to study issues such as crawling,
      information extraction, and answering subscribed queries.

    With the NSF award 1030002,
      we will study how to support powerful keyword search with
      efficient indexing structures and algorithms in a
      clouding-computing infrastructure. A main application is
      supporting family reunification in disasters such as the Haiti
      Earthquake.  Check our portals for the Haiti
      Earthquake and Chile Earthquake.  The
      main challenge is how to use limited programming primitives in
      the cloud to implement index structures and search algorithms.

 I am PhD student in Software engineering at the University of California Irvine
in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science.
My advisor is professor Andr¨¦ van der Hoek.

My research focus is on enabling more people to contribute to software development. I am particularly 
curious about the sheer amount of knowledge and context people gather to accomplish complex tasks (e.g., refactoring or fixing an existing system). 
This poses several interesting challenges. For instance, how size of tasks affect performance? How tasks differ in terms of context and information needs? 
Which tasks can be performed in parallel and which ones demand explicit coordination? Are there compromises impacting quality, time, and cost? 
I am currently exploring these questions in the realm of software debugging. For that I am developing tools to help people divide work , perform
smaller tasks, and make sense of aggregated results.


As I study and do research, my interests usually span the topics of program comprehension, program analysis, software
architecture, and software design. Education is my cross-cutting interest, especially teaching through case studies and applying alternative approaches for evaluation.


 If you are an undergrad or master student interested in developing an individual project, please contact me! 
I am actively collaborating with a set of brilliant people.

          Abstract
          In this paper we study how to efficiently perform
            set-similarity joins in parallel using the popular
            MapReduce framework.  We propose a 3-stage approach for
            end-to-end set-similarity joins. We take as input a set of
            records and output a set of joined records based on a
            set-similarity condition. We efficiently partition the
            data across nodes in order to balance the workload and
            minimize the need for replication. We study both self-join
            and R-S join cases, and show how to carefully control the
            amount of data kept in main memory on each node. We also
            propose solutions for the case where, even if we use the
            most fine-grained partitioning, the data still does not
            fit in the main memory of a node. We report results from
            extensive experiments on real datasets, synthetically
            increased in size, to evaluate the speedup and scaleup
            properties of the proposed algorithms using Hadoop.

          Abstract 
          In recent years, many websites have started providing keyword-search 
          services on maps. In these systems, users may experience difficulties 
          finding the entities they are looking for if they do not know their 
          exact spelling, such as the name of a restaurant. In this paper, we 
          present a solution to support fuzzy keyword search on spatial data. 
          We combine a spatial index structure with inverted indexes on grams 
          to efficiently answer fuzzy queries on maps. We show two system 
          prototypes to demonstrate the practicality of our solution.

Prerequisites for Installing AsterixDBSection 1: Single-Machine AsterixDB installationSection 2: Single-Machine AsterixDB installation (Advanced)Section 3: Installing AsterixDB on a Cluster of Multiple MachinesSection 4: Managing the Lifecycle of an AsterixDB InstanceSection 5: Frequently Asked Questions
This is a quickstart guide for getting AsterixDB running in a distributed environment. This guide also introduces the AsterixDB installer (nicknamed Managix) and describes how it can be used to create and manage an AsterixDB instance. By following the simple steps described in this guide, you will get a running instance of AsterixDB. You shall be able to use AsterixDB from its Web interface and manage its lifecycle using Managix. This document assumes that you are running some version of Linux or MacOS X.

Prerequisites for Installing AsterixDB [Back to TOC]
Prerequisite:

JDK7 (Otherwise known as JDK 1.7).
To know the version of Java installed on your system, execute the following:


    $ java -version

If you have version as 1.7.0_x, similar to the output shown below, you are good to proceed.


    java version "1.7.0_13"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_13-b20)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.7-b01, mixed mode)

If you need to upgrade or install java, please follow the instructions below.


For Linux: JDK 7 Linux Install JDK would be installed at a path under /usr/lib/jvm/jdk-version .
For Mac: JDK 7 Mac Install JDK would be installed at /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-version/Contents/Home .
The java installation directory is referred as JAVA_HOME. Since we upgraded/installed Java, we need to ensure JAVA_HOME points to the installation directory of JDK 7. Modify your ~/.bash_profile (or ~/.bashrc) and define JAVA_HOME accordingly. After the modification, execute the following:


    $ java -version

If the version information you obtain does not show 1.7, you need to update the PATH variable. To do so, execute the following:


    $ echo "PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bash_profile (or ~/.bashrc)
    $ source ~/.bash_profile (or ~/.bashrc)


Section 1: Single-Machine AsterixDB installation [Back to TOC]
We assume a user called ¡°Joe¡± with a home directory as /home/joe. On a Mac, the home directory for user Joe would be /Users/joe.

Configuring Environment
Ensure that JAVA_HOME variable is defined and points to the the java installation directory on your machine. To verify, execute the following:


    $ echo $JAVA_HOME

If you do not see any output, JAVA_HOME is not defined. We need to add the following line to your profile located at /home/joe/.bash_profile or /home/joe/.bashrc, whichever you are using. If you do not have any of these files, create a ~/.bash_profile file.


    export JAVA_HOME=<Path to Java installation directory>

After you have edited ~/.bash_profile (or ~/.bashrc), execute the following to make the changes effective in current shell:


    $ source /home/joe/.bash_profile (or /home/joe/.bashrc)

Before proceeding, verify that JAVA_HOME is defined by executing the following:


    $ echo $JAVA_HOME


Configuring SSH
If SSH is not enabled on your system, please follow the instruction below to enable/install it or else skip to the section Configuring Password-less SSH.

Enabling SSH on Mac
The Apple Mac OS X operating system has SSH installed by default but the SSH daemon is not enabled. This means you can¡¯t login remotely or do remote copies until you enable it. To enable it, go to ¡®System Preferences¡¯. Under ¡®Internet & Networking¡¯ there is a ¡®Sharing¡¯ icon. Run that. In the list that appears, check the ¡®Remote Login¡¯ option. Also check the ¡°All users¡± radio button for ¡°Allow access for¡±. This starts the SSH daemon immediately and you can remotely login using your username. The ¡®Sharing¡¯ window shows at the bottom the name and IP address to use. You can also find this out using ¡®whoami¡¯ and ¡®ifconfig¡¯ from the Terminal application.

Enabling SSH on Linux


    sudo apt-get install openssh-server

Assumming that you have enabled SSH on your system, let us proceed.

Configuring Password-less SSH
For our single-machine setup of AsterixDB, we need to configure password-less SSH access to localhost. We assume that you are on the machine where you want to install AsterixDB. To verify if you already have password-less SSH configured, execute the following:


     $ ssh 127.0.0.1

If you get an output similar to one shown below, type ¡°yes¡± and press enter.


    The authenticity of host '127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is aa:7b:51:90:74:39:c4:f6:28:a2:9d:47:c2:8d:33:31.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

If you are not prompted for a password, that is if you get an output similar to one shown below, it signifies that you already have password-less SSH configured. 


    $ ssh 127.0.0.1
    Last login: Sat Mar 23 22:52:49 2013

[Important: Password-less SSH requires the use of a (public,private) key-pair. The key-pair is located as a pair of files under  $HOME/.ssh directory. It is required that the (public,private) key-pair files have default names (id_rsa.pub, id_rsa) respectively.  If you are using different names, please rename the files to use the default names]
Skip to the next section Configuring Managix.
You are here because you were prompted for a password. You need to configure password-less SSH.We shall generate a (public,private) key-pair as id_rsa.pub and id_rsa respectively. If $HOME/.ssh already contains a (public,private) key-pair, please ensure the files are renamed before proceeding. Follow the instructions below.


     $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -P ""
    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/home/joe/.ssh/id_rsa):   
    [Important: Please ensure that we use the default value, so simply press enter]

If a key already exists, you should get an output similar to what is shown below. Press ¡®y¡¯ to overwrite the existing key. It is required to use the default name. If you wish to not overwrite a pre-existing key, ensure that the pre-existing key is saved with a different name.


    /home/joe/.ssh/id_rsa already exists.
    Overwrite (y/n)?

You should see an output similar to one shown below:


    The key fingerprint is:
    4d:b0:30:14:45:cc:99:86:15:48:17:0b:39:a0:05:ca joe@joe-machine
    The key's randomart image is:
    +--[ RSA 2048]----+
    |  ..o+B@O=       |
    |.. o  ==*+       |
    |.E.    oo .      |
    |         o       |
    |        S .      |
    |                 |
    |                 |
    |                 |
    |                 |
    +-----------------+

Note: for Linux users, you may not get an image representation of the key, but this is not an error. Next, execute the following:


      $ cat $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys
      $ chmod 700  $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys

We shall now retry SSH without password.


    $ ssh 127.0.0.1

You may see an output similar to one shown below:


    The authenticity of host '127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is aa:7b:51:90:74:39:c4:f6:28:a2:9d:47:c2:8d:33:31.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

Type ¡®yes¡¯ and press the enter key. You should see an output similar to one shown below:


    Warning: Permanently added '127.0.0.1' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
    Last login: Thu Mar 28 12:27:10 2013

You should now be able to log in without being prompted for a password or a response.


    ssh 127.0.0.1
    Last login: Sat Mar 23 22:54:40 2013

Execute ¡®exit¡¯ to close the session.


    $ exit
    logout
    Connection to 127.0.0.1 closed.


Configuring Managix
You will need the AsterixDB installer (a.k.a. Managix). Download Managix from here; this includes the bits for Managix as well as AsterixDB.
Unzip the Managix zip bundle to an appropriate location. You may create a sub-directory called ¡°asterix-mgmt¡± (short for asterix-management) under your home directory. We shall refer to this location as MANAGIX_HOME.


      $ cd ~
      /home/joe> $ mkdir asterix-mgmt
      /home/joe> $ cd asterix-mgmt
      /home/joe/asterix-mgmt> $ unzip  <path to the Managix zip bundle>
      /home/joe/asterix-mgmt> $ export MANAGIX_HOME=`pwd`
      /home/joe/asterix-mgmt> $ export PATH=$PATH:$MANAGIX_HOME/bin

It is recommended that you add $MANAGIX_HOME/bin to your PATH variable in your bash profile . This step can be done by executing the following.


    currentDir=`pwd`
    echo "export MANAGIX_HOME=$currentDir" >> ~/.bash_profile
    echo "export PATH=$PATH:$MANAGIX_HOME/bin" >> ~/.bash_profile

Above, use ~/.bashrc instead of ~/.bash_profile if you are using ~/.bashrc .
To be able to create an AsterixDB instance and manage its lifecycle, the Managix requires you to configure a set of configuration files namely:

conf/managix-conf.xml: A configuration XML file that contains configuration settings for Managix.A configuration XML file that describes the nodes in the cluster, e.g., $MANAGIX_HOME/clusters/local/local.xml.
Since we intend to run AsterixDB on a single node, Managix can auto-configure itself and populate the above configuration files. To auto-configure Managix, execute the following in the MANAGIX_HOME directory:


     /home/joe/asterix-mgmt> $ managix configure

Let us do a sample run to validate the set of configuration files auto-generated by Managix.


    /home/joe/asterix-mgmt> $ managix validate
      INFO: Environment [OK]
      INFO: Managix Configuration [OK]


    /home/joe/asterix-mgmt> $ managix validate -c $MANAGIX_HOME/clusters/local/local.xml
      INFO: Environment [OK]
      INFO: Cluster configuration [OK]


Creating an AsterixDB instance
Now that we have configured Managix, we shall next create an AsterixDB instance. An AsterixDB instance is identified by a unique name and is created using the create command. The usage description for the create command can be obtained by executing the following:


     $ managix help -cmd create
     Creates an AsterixDB instance with a specified name. Post creation, the instance is in ACTIVE state,
     indicating its availability for executing statements/queries.
     Usage arguments/options:
     -n Name of the AsterixDB instance.
     -c Path to the cluster configuration file

We shall now use the create command to create an AsterixDB instance by the name ¡°my_asterix¡±. In doing so, we shall use the cluster configuration file that was auto-generated by Managix.


     $ managix create -n my_asterix -c $MANAGIX_HOME/clusters/local/local.xml

A sample output of the above command is shown below:


    INFO: Name:my_asterix
    Created:Thu Mar 07 11:14:13 PST 2013
    Web-Url:http://127.0.0.1:19001
    State:ACTIVE

The third line above shows the web-url http://127.0.0.1:19001 for an AsterixDB¡¯s web interface. The AsterixDB instance is in the ¡®ACTIVE¡¯ state, indicating that you may access the web interface by navigating to the web url.
Type in the following ¡°Hello World¡± query in the box:


    let $message := 'Hello World!'
    return $message

Press the ¡°Run¡± button. If the query result shows on the output box, then Congratulations! You have successfully created an AsterixDB instance!

Section 2: Single-Machine AsterixDB installation (Advanced) [Back to TOC]
We assume that you have successfully completed the single-machine AsterixDB installation by following the instructions above in section AsterixDB installation. In this section, we shall cover advanced topics related to AsterixDB configuration. Before we proceed, it is imperative to go through some preliminary concepts related to AsterixDB runtime.

AsterixDB Runtime
An AsterixDB runtime comprises of a ¡®¡®master node¡¯¡¯ and a set of ¡®¡®worker nodes¡¯¡¯, each identified by a unique id. The master node runs a ¡®¡®Cluster Controller¡¯¡¯ service (a.k.a. ¡®¡®CC¡¯¡¯), while each worker node runs a ¡®¡®Node Controller¡¯¡¯ service (a.k.a. ¡®¡®NC¡¯¡¯). Please note that a node in an AsterixDB cluster is a logical concept in the sense that multiple nodes may map to a single physical machine, which is the case for a single-machine AsterixDB installation. This association or mapping between an AsterixDB node and a physical machine is captured in a cluster configuration XML file. In addition, the XML file contains properties and parameters associated with each node.

AsterixDB Runtime Configuration
As observed earlier, Managix can auto-configure itself for a single-machine setup. As part of auto-configuration, Managix generated the cluster XML file. Let us understand the components of the generated cluster XML file. If you have configured Managix (via the configure command), you can find a similar cluster XML file as $MANAGIX_HOME/clusters/local/local.xml. The following is a sample XML file generated on a Ubuntu (Linux) setup:


    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
    <cluster xmlns="cluster">
        <name>local</name>
        <java_home>/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0</java_home>
        <log_dir>/home/joe/asterix-mgmt/clusters/local/working_dir/logs</log_dir>
        <txn_log_dir>/home/joe/asterix-mgmt/clusters/local/working_dir/logs</txn_log_dir>
        <iodevices>/home/joe/asterix-mgmt/clusters/local/working_dir</iodevices>
        <store>storage</store>
        <working_dir>
            <dir>/home/joe/asterix-mgmt/clusters/local/working_dir</dir>
            <NFS>true</NFS>
        </working_dir>
        <master_node>
            <id>master</id>
            <client-ip>127.0.0.1</client-ip>
            <cluster-ip>127.0.0.1</cluster-ip>
            <client_port>1098</client_port>
            <cluster_port>1099</cluster_port>
            <http_port>8888</http_port>
        </master_node>
        <node>
            <id>node1</id>
            <cluster_ip>127.0.0.1</cluster_ip>
        </node>
    </cluster>

We shall next explain the components of the cluster configuration XML file.

(1) Defining nodes in AsterixDB runtime
The single-machine AsterixDB instance configuration that is auto-generated by Managix (using the configure command) involves a master node (CC) and a worker node (NC). Each node is assigned a unique id and provided with an ip address (called ¡®¡®cluster-ip¡¯¡¯) that maps a node to a physical machine. The following snippet from the above XML file captures the master/worker nodes in our AsterixDB installation.


        <master_node>
            <id>master</id>
            <client-ip>127.0.0.1</client-ip>
            <cluster-ip>127.0.0.1</cluster-ip>
            <client_port>1098</client_port>
            <cluster_port>1099</cluster_port>
            <http_port>8888</http_port>
        </master_node>
        <node>
            <id>node1</id>
            <cluster_ip>127.0.0.1</cluster_ip>
        </node>

The following is a description of the different elements in the cluster configuration xml file.

PropertyDescriptionidA unique id for a node.cluster_ipIP address of the machine to which a node maps to. This address is used for all internal communication between the nodes.client-ipProvided for the master node. This IP should be reachable from clients that want to connect with AsterixDB via its web interface.client-portProvided for the master node. This is the port at which the Cluster Controller (CC) service listens for connections from clients.cluster-portProvided for the master node. This is the port used by the Cluster Controller (CC) service to listen for connections from Node Controllers (NCs). http-portProvided for the master node. This is the http port used by the Cluster Controller (CC) service. 

(2) Properties associated with a worker node (NC) in AsterixDB
The following is a list of properties associated with each worker node in an AsterixDB configuration.

PropertyDescriptionjava_homeJava installation directory at each node.log_dirA directory where the worker node JVM may write logs.txn_log_dirA directory where the worker node writes transaction logs.iodevicesComma separated list of IO Device mount points.storeA data directory (under each iodevice) that AsterixDB uses to store data belonging to dataset(s).
All the above properties can be defined at the global level or a local level. In the former case, these properties apply to all the nodes in an AsterixDB configuration. In the latter case, these properties apply only to the node(s) under which they are defined. A property defined at the local level overrides the definition at the global level.

(3) Working directory of an AsterixDB instance
Next we explain the following setting in the file $MANAGIX_HOME/clusters/local/local.xml.


        <working_dir>
            <dir>/Users/joe/asterix-mgmt/clusters/local/working_dir</dir>
            <NFS>true</NFS>
        </working_dir>

Managix associates a working directory with an AsterixDB instance and uses this directory for transferring binaries to each node. If there is a directory that is readable by each node, Managix can use it to place binaries that can be accessed and used by all the nodes in the AsterixDB set up. A network file system (NFS) provides such a functionality for a cluster of physical machines so that a path on NFS is accessible from each machine in the cluster. In the single-machine set up described above, all nodes correspond to a single physical machine. Each path on the local file system is accessible to all the nodes in the AsterixDB setup and the boolean value for NFS above is thus set to true.

Managix Configuration
Managix allows creation and management of multiple AsterixDB instances and uses Zookeeper as its back-end database to keep track of information related to each instance. We need to provide a set of one or more hosts that Managix can use to run a Zookeeper instance. Zookeeper runs as a daemon process on each of the specified hosts. At each host, Zookeeper stores data under the Zookeeper home directory specified as part of the configuration. The following is an example configuration $MANAGIX_HOME/conf/managix-conf.xml that has Zookeeper running on the localhost (127.0.0.1) :


    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
    <configuration xmlns="installer">
        <zookeeper>
            <homeDir>/home/joe/asterix/.installer/zookeeper</homeDir>
            <clientPort>2900</clientPort>
            <servers>
                <server>127.0.0.1</server>
            </servers>
        </zookeeper>
    </configuration>

It is possible to have a single host for Zookeeper. A larger number of hosts would use Zookeeper¡¯s replication and fault-tolerance feature such that a failure of a host running Zookeeper would not result in loss of information about existing AsterixDB instances.

Section 3: Installing AsterixDB on a Cluster of Multiple Machines[Back to TOC]
We assume that you have read the two sections above on single-machine AsterixDB setup. Next we explain how to install AsterixDB in a cluster of multiple machines. As an example, we assume we want to setup AsterixDB on a cluster of three machines, in which we use one machine (called machine A) as the master node and two other machines (called machine B and machine C) as the worker nodes, as shown in the following diagram:

Notice that each machine has a ¡®¡®cluster_ip¡¯¡¯ address, which is used by these machines for their intra-cluster communication. Meanwhile, the master machine also has a ¡®¡®client_ip¡¯¡¯ address, using which an end-user outside the cluster can communicate with this machine. The reason we differentiate between these two types of IP addresses is that we can have a cluster of machines using a private network. In this case they have internal ip addresses that cannot be used outside the network. In the case all the machines are on a public network, the ¡°client_ip¡± and ¡°cluster_ip¡± of the master machine can share the same address.
Next we describe how to set up AsterixDB in this cluster, assuming no Managix has been installed on these machines.

Step (1): Define the AsterixDB cluster
We first log into the master machine as the user ¡°joe¡±. On this machine, download Managix from here (save as above), then do the following steps similar to the single-machine case described above:


    machineA> cd ~
    machineA> mkdir asterix-mgmt
    machineA> cd asterix-mgmt
    machineA> unzip  <path to the Managix zip bundle>
    machineA> export MANAGIX_HOME=`pwd`
    machineA> export PATH=$PATH:$MANAGIX_HOME/bin

Note that it is recommended that MANAGIX_HOME is not located on a network file system (NFS). Managix creates artifacts/logs that are not required to be shared. Any overhead associated with creating artifacts/logs on the NFS should be avoided. 
We also need an AsterixDB configuration XML file for the cluster. We give the name to the cluster, say, ¡°rainbow¡±. We create a folder for the configuration of this cluster:


    machineA> mkdir $MANAGIX_HOME/rainbow_cluster

For this cluster we create a configuration file $MANAGIX_HOME/rainbow_cluster/rainbow.xml. The following is a sample file with explanation of the properties:


    <cluster xmlns="cluster">

      <!-- Name of the cluster -->
      <name>rainbow</name>

      <!-- username, which should be valid for all the three machines -->
      <username>joe</username>

      <!-- The working directory of Managix. It is recommended for the working
           directory to be on a network file system (NFS) that can accessed by
           all machines. 
           Managix creates the directory if it it doesn't exist. -->
      <working_dir>
        <dir>/home/joe/managix-workingDir</dir>
        <NFS>true</NFS>
      </working_dir>

      <!-- Directory for Asterix to store log information for each machine.
           Needs to be on the local file system of each machine.
           Managix creates the directory if it doesn't exist. 
           This property can be overriden for a node by redefining at the node level. -->
      <logdir>/mnt/joe/logs</logdir>

      <!-- Mount point of an iodevice. Use a comma separated list for a machine that
           has multiple iodevices (disks).
           This property can be overriden for a node by redefining at the node level. -->
      <iodevices>/mnt/joe</iodevices>

      <!-- Path on each iodevice where Asterix will store its data -->
      <store>storage</store>

      <!-- Java home for each machine -->
      <java_home>/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0</java_home>

       <!-- IP addresses of the master machine A -->
      <master_node>
        <id>master</id>
        <client_ip>128.195.52.177</client_ip>
        <cluster_ip>192.168.100.0</cluster_ip>
        <client_port>1098</client_port>
        <cluster_port>1099</cluster_port>
        <http_port>8888</http_port>
      </master_node>

       <!-- IP address(es) of machine B -->
      <node>
        <id>nodeB</id>
        <cluster_ip>192.168.100.1</cluster_ip>
      </node>

       <!-- IP address(es) of machine C -->
      <node>
        <id>nodeC</id>
        <cluster_ip>192.168.100.2</cluster_ip>
      </node>
    </cluster>

As stated before, each of the above properties can be defined at the cluster level, in which case it applies to all the nodes in the system. Each property can also be defined at a node level.
Once we have formed the cluster XML file, we can validate the configuration by doing the following:


    managix validate -c $MANAGIX_HOME/rainbow_cluster/rainbow.xml

If the return message says ¡°OK¡±, it means that the XML configuration file is set properly.

Step (2): Configure SSH
The next steps of setting up SSH are similar to those in the single-machine setup case. We assume we have a common user account called ¡°joe¡± on each machine in the cluster.
On the master machine, do the following:


    machineA> ssh 127.0.0.1

If you get an output similar to one shown below, type ¡°yes¡± and press enter.


    The authenticity of host '127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is aa:7b:51:90:74:39:c4:f6:28:a2:9d:47:c2:8d:33:31.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

If you are not prompted for a password, that is if you get an output similar to one shown below, it signifies that you already have password-less SSH configured. 


    $ ssh 127.0.0.1
    Last login: Sat Mar 23 22:52:49 2013

[Important: Password-less SSH requires the use of a (public,private) key-pair. The key-pair is located as a pair of files under  $HOME/.ssh directory. It is required that the (public,private) key-pair files have default names (id_rsa.pub, id_rsa) respectively.  If you are using different names, please rename the files to use the default names]
If you are prompted for a password, execute the following


    machineA> ssh-keygen -t rsa -P ""
    machineA> cat $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys
    machineA> chmod 700  $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys

If $HOME is not on the NFS, copy the id_rsa.pub to the directory ~/.ssh (login with the same account) on each machine, and then do the following on each machine. (Notice that this step is not needed if the folder ¡°.ssh¡± is on the NFS and can be accessed by all the nodes.)


    cd ~/.ssh
    cat id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys
    chmod 700  $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys

Then run the following step again and type ¡°yes¡± if prompted:


    machineA> ssh 127.0.0.1


Step (3): Configuring Managix
Managix uses a configuration XML file at $MANAGIX_HOME/conf/managix-conf.xml to configure its own properties, such as its Zookeeper service. We can use the configure command to auto-generate this configuration file:


    machineA> managix configure

We use the validate command to validate the Managix configuration. To do so, execute the following.


    machineA> managix validate
    INFO: Environment [OK]
    INFO: Managix Configuration [OK]

Note that the configure command also generates a cluster configuration XML file at $MANAGIX_HOME/conf/clusters/local.xml. This file is not needed in the case of a cluster of machines.

Step (4): Creating an AsterixDB instance
Now that we have configured Managix, we shall next create an AsterixDB instance, which is identified by a unique name and is created using the create command. The usage description for the create command can be obtained by executing the following:


    machineA> managix help -cmd create

     Creates an AsterixDB instance with a specified name. Post creation, the instance is in ACTIVE state,
     indicating its availability for executing statements/queries.
     Usage arguments/options:
     -n Name of the AsterixDB instance.
     -c Path to the cluster configuration file

We shall now use the create command to create an AsterixDB instance called ¡°rainbow_asterix¡±. In doing so, we shall use the cluster configuration file that was auto-generated by Managix.


    machineA> managix create -n rainbow_asterix -c $MANAGIX_HOME/clusters/rainbow.xml

If the response message does not have warning, then Congratulations! You have successfully installed AsterixDB on this cluster of machines!
Please refer to the section Managing the Lifecycle of an AsterixDB Instance for a detailed description on the set of available commands/operations that let you manage the lifecycle of an AsterixDB instance. Note that the output of the commands varies with the cluster definition and may not apply to the cluster specification you built above.

Section 4: Managing the Lifecycle of an AsterixDB Instance [Back to TOC]
Now that we have an AsterixDB instance running, let us use Managix to manage the instance¡¯s lifecycle. Managix provides the following set of commands/operations:


Managix Commands

CommandDescriptioncreateCreates a new asterix instance.describeDescribes an existing asterix instance.stopStops an asterix instance that is in the ACTIVE state.startStarts an AsterixDB instance.backupCreates a backup for an existing AsterixDB instance.restoreRestores an AsterixDB instance.deleteDeletes an AsterixDB instance.validateValidates the installer/cluster configuration.configureAuto generates a configuration for an AsterixDB instance.logProduces a zip archive containing log files from each node in an AsterixDB instance.shutdownShuts down the installer service.
You may obtain the above listing by simply executing ¡®managix¡¯ :


    $ managix

We already talked about create and validate commands. We shall next explain the rest of the commands listed above. We also provide sample output messages of these commands assuming we are running an AsterixDB instance on a single machine.

Describe Command
The describe command provides information about an AsterixDB instance. The usage can be looked up by executing the following:


     $ managix help -cmd describe

        Provides information about an AsterixDB instance.
        The following options are available:
        [-n]      Name of the AsterixDB instance.
        [-admin]  Provides a detailed description

The brackets indicate optional flags.
The output of the describe command when used without the admin flag contains minimal information and is similar to the output of the create command. Let us try running the describe command in ¡°admin¡± mode.


     $ managix describe -n my_asterix -admin

As seen above, the instance ¡®my_asterix¡¯ is configured such that all processes running at the localhost (127.0.0.1). The process id for each process (JVM) is shown next to it.

Stop Command
The stop command can be used for shutting down an AsterixDB instance. After that, the instance is unavailable for executing queries. The usage can be looked up by executing the following.


     $ managix help -cmd stop

     Shuts an AsterixDB instance that is in ACTIVE state. After executing the stop command, the AsterixDB instance transits
     to the INACTIVE state, indicating that it is no longer available for executing queries.

     Available arguments/options
     -n name of the AsterixDB instance.

To stop the AsterixDB instance.


     $ managix stop -n my_asterix
       INFO: Stopped AsterixDB instance: my_asterix


     $ managix describe -n my_asterix
       INFO: Name: my_asterix

       State:INACTIVE (Fri Mar 08 09:49:00 PST 2013)


Start Command
The start command starts an AsterixDB instance that is in the INACTIVE state. The usage can be looked up by executing the following:


     $ managix help -cmd start

     Starts an AsterixDB instance that is in INACTIVE state. After executing the start command, the AsterixDB instance transits to the ACTIVE state,  indicating that it is now available for executing statements/queries.

     Available arguments/options
     -n name of the AsterixDB instance.

Let us now start the AsterixDB instance.


     $ managix start -n my_asterix
       INFO: Name:my_asterix
       Created:Thu Mar 07 19:07:00 PST 2013
       Web-Url:http://127.0.0.1:19001
       State:ACTIVE (Fri Mar 08 09:49:00 PST 2013)


Backup Command
The backup command allows you to take a backup of the data stored with an AsterixDB instance. The backup can be taken on the local file system or on an HDFS instance. In either case, the snapshots are stored under a backup directory. You need to make sure the backup directory has appropriate read/write permissions. Configuring settings for backup can be found inside the Managix¡¯s configuration file located at $MANAGIX_HOME/conf/managix-conf.xml.
Configuring backup on the local file system
We need to provide a path to a backup directory on the local file system. The backup directory can be configured be editing the Managix configuration XML, found at $MANAGIX_HOME/conf/managix-conf.xml.


    <backup>
      <backupDir>Provide path to the backup directory here</backupDir>
    </backup>

Prior to taking a backup of an AsterixDB instance, it is required for the instance to be in the INACTIVE state. We do so by using the stop command, as shown below:


    $ managix stop -n my_asterix
      INFO: Stopped AsterixDB instance: my_asterix

We can now take the backup by executing the following:


    $ managix backup -n my_asterix
      INFO: my_asterix backed up 0_Fri Mar 08 16:16:34 PST 2013 (LOCAL)

Configuring backup on an HDFS instance
To configure a backup to be taken on an HDFS instance, we need to provide required information about the running HDFS instance. This information includes the HDFS version and the HDFS url. Simply edit the Managix configuration file and provide the required information.


    <backup>
       <backupDir>Provide path to the backup directory here</backupDir>
       <hdfs>
           <version>0.20.2</version>
           <url></url>
       </hdfs>
    </backup>

A sample output when a backup is taken on an HDFS is shown below:


    $ managix backup -n my_asterix
      INFO: my_asterix backed up 1_Fri Mar 08 17:10:38 PST 2013 (HDFS)

Each time we take a backup, we are provided with a unique id (a monotonically increasing value starting with 0). This id is required when we need to restore from a previously taken backup. Information about all available backup snapshots can be obtained by using the describe command in the admin mode, as shown below:


     $ managix describe -n my_asterix -admin
     INFO: Name:my_asterix
     Created:Fri Mar 08 15:11:12 PST 2013
     Web-Url:http://127.0.0.1:19001
     State:INACTIVE (Fri Mar 08 16:14:20 PST 2013)
     Master node:master:127.0.0.1
     node1:127.0.0.1

     Backup:0 created at Fri Mar 08 16:16:34 PST 2013 (LOCAL)
     Backup:1 created at Fri Mar 08 17:10:38 PST 2013 (HDFS)

     Asterix version:0.0.5
     Asterix Configuration
     Metadata Node:node1
     Processes

The above output shows the available backup identified by it¡¯s id (0). We shall next describe the method for restoring an AsterixDB instance from a backup snapshot.

Restore Command
The restore command allows you to restore an AsterixDB instance¡¯s data from a previously taken backup. The usage description can be obtained as follows:


      $ managix help -cmd restore

      Restores an AsterixDB instance's data from a previously taken backup.
      Available arguments/options

      -n name of the AsterixDB instance
      -b id of the backup snapshot

The following command restores our AsterixDB instance from the backup snapshot identified by the id (0). Prior to restoring an instance from a backup, it is required that the instance is in the INACTIVE state.


     $ managix restore -n my_asterix -b 0
     INFO: AsterixDB instance: my_asterix has been restored from backup

You can start the AsterixDB instance by using the start command.

Log Command
The log command allows you to collect the log files coresponding to each node of an AsterixDB instance into a zip archive. The zip archive is produced on the local file system of the machine running managix. 


      $ managix help -cmd log

      Creates a zip archive containing log files corresponding to each worker node (NC) and the master (CC)  for an AsterixDB instance

      Available arguments/options
      -n name of the AsterixDB instance. 
      -d destination directory for producing the zip archive. Defaults to $MANAGIX_HOME/logdump.

The following is an example showing the use of the log command. 


     $ managix log -n my_asterix -d  /Users/joe/logdump
     INFO: Log zip archive created at /Users/joe/logdump/log_Thu_Jun_06_00:53:51_PDT_2013.zip


Delete Command
As the name suggests, the delete command permanently removes an AsterixDB instance by cleaning up all associated data/artifacts. The usage can be looked up by executing the following:


      $ managix help -cmd delete
      Permanently deletes an AsterixDB instance. The instance must be in the INACTIVE state.

      Available arguments/options
      -n name of the AsterixDB instance.


      $ managix delete -n my_asterix
       INFO: AsterixDB instance my_asterix deleted.


Shutdown Command
Managix uses Zookeeper service for storing all information about created AsterixDB instances. The Zookeeper service runs in the background and can be shut down using the shutdown command.


      $ managix shutdown


Help Command
The help command provides a usage description of a Managix command.


    $ managix help -cmd <command name>

As an example, for looking up the help for the configure command, execute the following


    $ managix help -cmd configure

    Auto-generates the AsterixDB installer configruation settings and AsterixDB cluster
    configuration settings for a single node setup.


Section 5: Frequently Asked Questions [Back to TOC]



Question
What happens if a machine acting as a node in the Asterix cluster becomes unreachable for some reason (network partition/machine failure) ?

Answer
When a node leaves the Asterix cluster, the AsterixDB instance transits to an ¡®UNUSABLE¡¯ state, indicating that it is no longer available for serving queries. To know which set of node(s) left the cluster, run the describe command with -admin flag. 


    $ $MANAGIX_HOME/bin/managix describe -n <name of the AsterixDB instance>-admin

Above command will show the state of AsterixDB instance and list the set of nodes that have left the cluster. 
The failed node must be brought back to re-join the cluster. Once done, you may bring back the instance to an ¡®ACTIVE¡¯ state by executing the following sequence. 
1) Get rid of the Asterix processes running on the nodes in the cluster:-


    $MANAGIX_HOME/bin/managix stop -n my_asterix

The processes associated with the instance are terminated and the instance moves to the INACTIVE state.
2) Start the AsterixDB instance using the start command.


    $MANAGIX_HOME/bin/managix start -n <name of your AsterixDB instance>


Question
Do I need to create all the directories/paths I put into the cluster configuration XML ?

Answer
Managix will create a path if it is not existing. It does so using the user account mentioned in the cluster configuration xml. Please ensure that the user account has appropriate permissions for creating the missing paths. 

Question
Should MANAGIX_HOME be on the network file system (NFS) ?

Answer
It is recommended that MANAGIX_HOME is not on the NFS. Managix produces artifacts/logs on disk which are not required to be shared. As such an overhead in creating the artifacts/logs on the NFS should be avoided.

Question
How do we change the underlying code (apply a code patch) for an ¡®active¡¯ asterix instance?

Answer
At times, end-user (particularly asterix developer) may run into the need to altering the underlying code that is being run by an asterix instance. In the current version of managix, this can be achieved as follows:-
Assume that you have an ¡®active¡¯ instance by the name a1 that is running version v1 of asterix. You have a revised version of asterix - v2 that fixes some bug(s).
To upgrade asterix from v1 to v2:-
step 1) managix stop -n a1
step 2) managix shutdown
step 3) copy asterix-server zip (version v2) to $MANAGIX_HOME/asterix/
step 4) managix start -n a1
a1 now is running on version v2.
Limitations:-
a) Obviously this wont work in a situation where v2 has made a change that is incompatible with earlier version, such altering schema.
b) A change in asterix zip applies to all existing instances (after a restart) and subsequent instances that user creates.

 E2E 
Environment to Environment Connectivity. Environment-to-Environment (E2E) connection is a new paradigm for communication which allows natural interactions among users. Each Environment is instrumented using as many different types of sensors as may be required to detect presence and activity of objects and to determine the situation of an environment. This object position and situation information is used by a scalable event-based multimodal information system called EventServer to share the appropriate experiential information with other environments as well as to present or render incoming multimedia information on right devices to make interactions effortless.
You can see the demos here.

 EMME 
Experiential Media Management Environment. Most current systems for media management are media-centric and manage their users¡¯ experiences according to the media assets captured. These systems are very limited in their functionality due to their focus on a medium. Even when multiple media types are supported, they are considered separately within the system.  We are developing concepts, architecture, and implementation of an event-based media management system. Events are a natural approach for organizing and managing human experience and their accompanying media assets. Events and entities work together to form a powerful mechanism to represent events in the real world and help manage multiple media in a natural and efficient manner.  In contrast to the media-centric approach, the event-based approach puts the actual experience of the users in terms of events in the focus. These ideas are being implemented in Experiential Media Management Environment (EMME) systems that will be publicly available for use in the second half of 2009.

The FLAMINGO Project on Data Cleaning
Department of Computer Science, UC Irvine


Objective

 The Flamingo Project focuses on data cleaning, i.e., how to
deal with errors and inconsistencies in information systems.  As an
example, in many applications such as data integration, commercial
organizations need to collect data from various sources to conduct
analysis and make decisions. Often, the data from these different
sources can have inconsistencies. For instance, we use first name,
last name, SSN, and birthday to identify a person. However, the same
name, e.g., "Schwarzenegger", may be misspelled as "Swarzzengaer" or
other forms. Such errors make it more challenging to link records from
different places and answer queries approximately.  We are developing
algorithms in order to make query answering and information retrieval
efficient in the presence of such inconsistencies and errors.

With the NSF
award IIS-0844574,
we plan to study the following problems.  Supporting fuzzy queries is
becoming increasingly more important in applications that need to deal
with a variety of data inconsistencies in structures, representations,
or semantics.  Many existing algorithms require an offline analysis of
data sets to construct an efficient index structure to support online
query processing. Fuzzy join queries of data sets are more time
consuming due to the computational complexity.  The PI is studying
three research problems: (1) constructing high-quality inverted lists
for fuzzy search queries using Hadoop; (2) supporting fuzzy joins of
large data sets using Hadoop; and (3) using the developed techniques
to improve data quality of large collections of documents.

With the NSF
award 1030002,
we will study how to support powerful keyword search with efficient
indexing structures and algorithms in a clouding-computing
infrastructure. A main application is supporting
family reunification in disasters
such as the Haiti Earthquake.  Check our portals for
the Haiti Earthquake
and Chile Earthquake.  The
main challenge is how to use limited programming primitives in the
cloud to implement index structures and search algorithms.

Getting Started
Introduction

This tutorial will guide through the basics steps needed to perform approximate string search on a collection of strings using this library. This guide focuses on how to use the FilterTree (FilterTreeDoc) module.

Downloading the Package
The entire package may be downloaded from http://flamingo.ics.uci.edu/releases/4.0/flamingo-4.0.tgz
Requirements

Most modules in this release were developed and tested on Ubuntu Linux using the GNU GCC/G++ compiler.


In order to compile and run most modules you will need the following:

Linux environment (preferably a Debian based Linux, e.g. Ubuntu)
C++ compiler (GCC/G++ version 4.0 or later)
CMake
C++ Boost library, http://www.boost.org (only required for PartEnumDoc)

On systems with the aptitude package manager (e.g. Ubuntu, Debian) you can install all required packages by typing the following as root user (or using sudo):

$ apt-get install gcc g++ cmake libboost-dev

The module MatTreeDoc was developed in Visual C++. No makefile is provided for that module. We recommend using Windows and Visual C++ for that module.

Wrappers (Simplest Way To Use The Library)

For your convenience, we have added wrappers that contain all necessary objects as described in section "Basic Usage". All you need to do to build an index and execute queries, is to create an instance of a wrapper. These wrappers initialize components with default values and are the simplest and fastest way to use our library - at the expense of being able to control tuning parameters (which filters are used, fanout, etc.). 
We recommend browsing through the code in filtertree/wrappers/src/example.cc.

Step-By-Step Guide

In this guide we will use a wrapper to show you how to perform approximate string search using the edit distance.

Step1: Compiling The Library

Let us first test whether we can successfully compile the Flamingo libraries. 
Let us say you have extracted the Flamingo archive to the following directory: /home/joe/flamingo-4.0 


The wrappers are part of the filtertree module which we compile as follows:

cd /home/joe/flamingo-4.0/src/filtertree/
cmake .
make

This should compile filtertree and the modules that it depends on, namely, util, common and listmerger.


The libraries and executables are placed in the build folder of their corresponding modules, 
e.g., the filtertree binaries are in /home/joe/flamingo-4.0/src/filtertree/build/, the listmerger binaries are in /home/joe/flamingo-4.0/src/listmerger/build/, and so on.


Your /home/joe/flamingo-4.0/src/filtertree/build/ should look something like this after compilation:

joe@joe-machine:~/flamingo-4.0/src/filtertree/build$ ls -l
-rwxr-xr-x 1 joe joe     18 2010-10-21 13:06 cleanup.sh
-rwxr-xr-x 1 joe joe 482093 2010-10-22 12:11 example_ft
-rwxr-xr-x 1 joe joe 307624 2010-10-22 12:11 example_wrappers
-rwxr-xr-x 1 joe joe 106208 2010-10-22 12:11 libfiltertree-lib.so
-rwxr-xr-x 1 joe joe   7043 2010-10-22 12:11 libwrappers-lib.so
-rwxr-xr-x 1 joe joe 376594 2010-10-22 12:12 perftest_ft
-rwxr-xr-x 1 joe joe 453066 2010-10-22 12:12 unittest_ft

(note that the exact file sizes may differ from yours)

Step2: Using The Library In An Application

Now that we have compiled the library, we are ready to include it into an application. 
Let us assume you wish to use the library in an application located in /home/joe/searchapp that consists of one source file /home/joe/searchapp/src/main.cc 
We assume a directory structure similar to the ones used in Flamingo, i.e., we expect /home/joe/searchapp to have a folder src and a folder build.  

We will discuss how to use a simple in-memory index. More examples can be found in /home/joe/flamingo-4.0/src/filtertree/wrappers/example.cc. 

You can copy and paste the following lines of source code into /home/joe/searchapp/src/main.cc for us to compile:

#include "filtertree/src/wrappers/wrappers.h"

int main() {
  GramGenFixedLen gramGen(2); // using 2-grams
  
  StringContainerVector strContainer(true);
  strContainer.initStatsCollector(&gramGen);
  strContainer.fillContainer("/home/joe/flamingo-4.0/src/filtertree/data/female_names.txt", 4000);
  
  // create wrapper using edit distance (ed) and build index
  // params: stringcontainer, gramgenerator, use partitioning filter?
  WrapperSimpleEd wrapper(&strContainer, &gramGen, true);
  wrapper.buildIndex();
  
  // perform search
  float editDistance = 1.0f;
  string queryString = "kathrin";
  vector<unsigned> resultStringIDs;
  wrapper.search(queryString, editDistance, resultStringIDs);
  cout << "SIMILAR STRINGS: " << endl;
  for(unsigned i = 0; i < resultStringIDs.size(); i++) {
    string tmp;
    strContainer.retrieveString(tmp, resultStringIDs[i]);
    cout << tmp << endl;
  }
}

In this example all data structures are stored in main memory. 
This application will use the first 4000 lines of /home/joe/flamingo-4.0/src/filtertree/data/female_names.txt as the data strings. 
It will build an index to support approximate string search and answer a query that asks for all data strings that are within an edit-distance of 1 to "kathrin". 
Finally, the results will be displayed. 


Please refer to /home/joe/flamingo-4.0/src/filtertree/wrappers/example.cc and /home/joe/flamingo-4.0/src/filtertree/example.cc for more examples.

Step3: Compiling And Running The Application

We recommend you use CMake to generate a makefile to build your application. Hand-crafting a makefile is also possible but requires more effort and understanding. We will discuss how to use CMake to build your application. 


We assume the following (as in the previous sections):

Your application is in /home/joe/searchapp 
Your application contains one source file /home/joe/searchapp/src/main.cc
Flamingo is in /home/joe/flamingo-4.0

Let us create the CMakeLists.txt used by CMake to generate a makefile. Following the convention in Flamingo we will put it in /home/joe/searchapp/CMakeLists.txt. 


You can copy and paste the following lines into /home/joe/searchapp/CMakeLists.txt:

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6)

# files to compile
set(APPLICATION_EXEC_SRC 
  src/main.cc
)

# where to look for header files
include_directories (
  .
  ../flamingo-4.0/src/
  ../flamingo-4.0/src/filtertree/
  ../flamingo-4.0/src/filtertree/src/
  ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/../
  include
  lib  
)

# where to look for dependent libraries
link_directories(
  ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/../flamingo-4.0/src/common/build/
  ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/../flamingo-4.0/src/util/build/
  ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/../flamingo-4.0/src/listmerger/build/
  ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/../flamingo-4.0/src/filtertree/build/
) 

# have cmake also build the filtertree module (if not built already)
# the filtertree module will build util, common and listmerger
add_subdirectory(../flamingo-4.0/src/filtertree/ ../flamingo-4.0/src/filtertree/)

# GCC command line args
add_definitions(-Wall -O3 -DDEBUG_TIMER_FANCY -DDEBUG_STAT -DED_MATRIX_DIM=2000)

# create executable
add_executable(searchapp ${APPLICATION_EXEC_SRC})
add_dependencies(searchapp wrappers-lib filtertree-lib common-lib util-lib listmerger-lib)
target_link_libraries(searchapp wrappers-lib filtertree-lib common-lib util-lib listmerger-lib rt)

set(EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/build/")

The above is a very simple CMakeLists.txt. To compile your application, cd into /home/joe/searchapp/ and type:

cmake .
make

This should compile your application and all necessary libraries and link them together properly. 
Let us test the application. The compilation should have placed your searchapp executable in /home/joe/searchapp/build. To run the application:

cd '''/home/joe/searchapp/build'''
./searchapp

You should see the following output (or similar):

INPUTFILE: "/home/joe/flamingo-4.0/src/filtertree/data/female_names.txt"
100% FILLING CONTAINER: 4000/4000; 0'0"/0'0"

Congratulations, you have successfully created your first application using The Flamingo Package!

Basic Usage

Approximate string search can be performed in two basic steps: (1) building the index, and (2) answering queries using the index.
We will now discuss the basic components for each of the steps at a high-level.

Building The Index, Needed Components
String Container (stores the data strings on which you want to perform queries)
Gram Generator (decomposes strings into grams)
Indexer (builds the filter tree and the inverted lists, needs a String Container and a Gram Generator)
Answering Queries Using The Index, Needed Components:
List Merger (solves the T-occurrence problem given a set of inverted lists and a merging-threshold)
Indexer (builds the filtertree and the inverted-lists, needs a String Container and a Gram Generator)
Searcher (answers queries, needs a List Merger and an Indexer) 
Similarity Metric (represents the similarity metric to be used)
Query (contains the query string, the similarity metric and the similarity threshold)

Refer to filtertree/src/example.cc for some advanced examples.

Example Files

Apart from reading this guide, we recommend you browse through the code of some example files. We have provided these files to help you understand how to use the library as quickly as possible.

StringMap
Overview

This module supports fuzzy string searching, i.e., finding strings similar to a given a string or a collection of strings, where similarity is defined using edit distance.  It supports both join queries and string-string-search queries.  The approach first maps strings into a high-dimensional Euclidean space.  An R-tree is constructed from the mapped objects. The program will sample from the strings to get a new threshold to be used to do search in the Euclidean space. A similarity string search is converted to a spatial search in the new Euclidean space using R-trees. [1,2] 

Usage
make clean
make
date; time ./stringmap_unittest; date  
After running it once, you can rerun it by using ./stringmap_unittest load to save some time to do the mapping and construct the R-tree for the single-string-search case.
stringmap_unittest.cpp shows how to use StringMap. Some parameters can be tuned, such as the sampling percentages, which should depend on the data size.
Some R-tree parameters are defined in rtreeparams.h. e.g., the dimensionality of the Euclidean space is set to 20.
Interface

This package includes three data files of names:

source1.txt (zipped to source1.zip) and source2.txt (zipped to source2.zip) are used for testing join queries
source.txt (zipped to source.zip) is used for testing single-string-search queries, which is a combination of source1.txt and source2.txt.
source-big.txt (zipped to source-big.zip) is used for testing single-string-search queries, which has more than 111K full names.
Performance

We ran this package on a Linux platform with a 2.8GHZ Pentium 4 with 1GB RAM. The join on source1.txt and source2.txt (2000 x 2000 strings) took about 105 seconds (including the time to compute the recall, which was  using nested loop and expensive), and with a recall of 98.9%.  We ran 100 single-string-search queries on 100K name strings, and the average search time is 0.079 seconds, with the average recall 98.8%.

SEPIA
Overview

The module contains the implementation of the technique presented in [1] and [2].

Usage

For compiling instructions, please see CompileDoc.


An example of how to use the module is available in src/sepia/example.cc.

Interface

The main class of the module is Sepia which is declared in src/sepia/sepia.h.


The main methods of Sepia are:

  Sepia(const vector<string> &dataset, 
        unsigned thresholdMin,
        unsigned thresholdMax);
  Sepia(const vector<string> &dataset,
        const string &filename);

  void build();
  void saveData(const string &filename) const;
  
  float getEstimateSelectivity(const string &query, unsigned editdist) const;

The main idea is that the user can create a Sepia object by specifying a vector of strings (dataset) and a few extra parameters (for details see [1]) or load an existing one from a file. If the object was not loaded, then it needs to be built. Next, the user has the option of saving the object to a file. In order to estimate the selectivity of a given string, the user calls select. 

Performance

The performance results are available in [1] and [2].

Top-k
Overview
The module contains an implementation of the technique presented
in [1].
Usage
For compiling instructions, please see CompileDoc.
The module uses C++ STL TR1 library provided by GNU GCC.
An example of how to use the module is available in
src/topk/example.cc.
Interface
The module is divided in three components:
Top-k IndexTop-k Query IndexTop-k Search Algorithms
The Top-k Index (Topk::Index) class is defined in
src/topk/topkindex.h. Its main methods are:

    Index();
    Index(const std::string &filename);

    template<class InputIterator> 
    void build(InputIterator begin, InputIterator end, const GramGen &gramGen);

    void load(const std::string &filename);

    void save(const std::string &filename)
      const;

The Top-k Query Index (Topk::IndexQuery) class contains
a part of the index that is relevant for a particular query. This
class is used by the search algorithms. It is defined in
src/topk/topkindex.h and its main method is:

    IndexQuery(const Index &idx, const Query &query);

The Top-k Search Algorithms are defined in multiple files. All
the algorithms define the getTopk method. Its prototype
is:

    template<
      class RandomAccessIterator1, 
      class RandomAccessIterator2, 
      class OutputIterator>  
    void getTopk(
      const RandomAccessIterator1 data, 
      const RandomAccessIterator2 weights, 
      const Index &idx, 
      const Query &que, 
      IndexQuery &idxQue, 
      OutputIterator topk);

The most popular algorithm is the heap-based algorithm. It is
defined in the src/topk/topkheap.h.
The main idea is that a Topk::Index object can be
created to hold the index. The index can be build by specifying an
iterator over a sequence of strings and a gram generator.
Additionally, the index can be saved to disk and then loaded from
disk. When a query comes, a Topk::IndexQuery object is
created using the Topk::Index instance and the query.
Finally, the search algorithm of choice can applied.

ListMerger
Introduction

This module provides list-merging algorithms for solving the T-occurrence problem in approximate string search.

Overview

The following list-merging algorithms are included:

HeapMerger - pop list-heads to a heap, push from heap and count occurrences of each element
ScanCount - uses one counter for every possible stringid (scan count array), traverses inverted lists and increments counts in the array
MergeOpt - separate long lists from short lists, for short lists use heap merge, for long lists do binary search on candidates from short lists
MergeSkip - like heapmerger, but uses the merging-threshold to skip elements on the lists
DivideSkip - combines MergeOpt and MergeSkip, skipping is used for the short lists, binary search is done on the long lists
OnDiskMergerSimple - reads inverted lists and runs DivideSkipMerger
OnDiskMergerAdapt - balances costs of reading inverted lists (from disk) and post-processing candidates (from disk)

LBAK-Tree
Introduction

This module provides location-based approximate keyword search. 


For example, it can answer queries such as find Alkatras near San Fransisco. Notice that Alkatras is misspelled but the LBAK-Tree can still find useful answers.
In short, the LBAK-Tree answers queries with a spatial component and a keyword component, where the keywords don't need to match exactly but approximately.

Overview

The LBAK-Tree is based on a hierarchical spatial index that is enhanced with inverted indexes for approximate string lookups. In our implementation we use an R*-Tree as spatial index and use the FilterTreeDoc module (part of Flamingo) to implement the inverted indexes for approximate string lookups.


Our paper Supporting Location-Based Approximate-Keyword Queries describes three variants of the LBAK-Tree which differ in where they place inverted indexes in the spatial index. This module contains all their implementations:

Fixed-Level (FL)
Inverted indexes are placed at one level in the R*-Tree



Variable-Level (VL)
Inverted indexes can be placed at different levels in the R*-Tree



Variable-Level Exploiting Keyword Frequencies (VLF)
Inverted indexes are placed at various levels, 
Keyword-frequencies are exploited to improve performance




Please have a look at example.cc in the lbaktree/src folder to get started!

Grading Policies
All Bren School and Major requirements must be taken for a letter grade unless the
required course is designated as ¡°P/NP Only¡±.
?

?
? Calculating your GPA
The Official UC GPA is calculated by dividing the total number of Grade Points by the total number of Attempted UC Units.
Letter GradeGrade PointsA4 points per unitB3 points per unitC2 points per unitD1 points per unitF and I (incomplete)0 points per unit
A+ grade is assigned 4 points per unit.
Plus or minus suffixes modify 
  the above by plus or minus 0.3 grade point per? unit. E.g., B+ is 3.3 points
  per unit, D- is 0.7 points per unit.
Non-letter grades (P, NP, I, etc.) are excluded in calculating GPA.

? Illegal Duplication of Credit 
Undergraduate
and graduate students may not receive unit credit or earn grade points for
college courses in which the content duplicates material of a previously
completed course or examination for which the student has been granted college
credit.
?
? Repeating
Deficient Grades 
A course may
be repeated only when grades of C-, D+, D, D-, F, or NP were received. Unit credit for courses so repeated will be given only once.
The grade assigned at each enrollment shall be permanently recorded. 
Only the most recently received grades
and grade points shall be used for the first 16 units repeated when calculating
GPA. (The grade point average is based on all additional grades assigned in
cases of further course repetitions.)

Copyright Infringement

It is illegal to distribute copyrighted materials -- such as software, movies, music, pictures -- without proper authorization. 
If a complaint of copyright infringement is reported involving a computer assigned to a Bren School student, the student's account will be locked out until Bren School support personnel have a chance to investigate the allegations. 
If copyrighted materials are found, they will be removed immediately.
For the initial complaint (first violation), the Bren School Student Affairs Office (SAO) staff and the appropriate Associate Dean (as well as the academic advisor, for grad students) will be notified. 
The student will be required to meet in person with appropriate SAO staff to review applicable campus policies, and to sign a statement verifying receipt and notice of such policies. 
This signed statement will become part of the student's file.
For any subsequent complaints, the appropriate Associate Dean, academic advisor (for graduate students) and SAO staff will be notified. 
The student will then be referred to the campus Director of Student Judicial Affairs, for academic suspension (upon 2nd violation) or expulsion from the university(upon 3rd violation).
The above statement is based upon:
                UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA POLICIES APPLYING TO CAMPUS ACTIVITIES, ORGANIZATIONS AND STUDENTS, UCI CAMPUS IMPLEMENTATION
                August 1996, APPENDIX K:
                Computer Use Policy (Reference to Section 102.05), which includes "Violating the terms of applicable software licensing agreements or copyright laws."
Please see the most current UCI Copyright Information.

Most computing in the Bren School is done on either UNIX based Sun workstations or on Windows based PCs. These machines have various uses -- research, departmental administration, undergraduate instruction, graduate instruction -- but all are networked together and share a common file space. 
In particular, no matter which departmental computer you use, either Windows or Sun, you will use the same account with the same home directory. 
 All Bren School majors receive both UNIX and Windows accounts. Non-major students receive accounts only if the  Bren School course they are enrolled in requires an account on a particular platform. 
There are directions for activating instructional accounts on-line at  Activating Instructional Accounts and in the CS 364 lab. 
 Bren School majors and other students enrolled in certain Bren School courses have access to a variety of computers in several labs. 
These machines allow you to: read and send e-mail, read announcements for your classes through newsgroups, and complete classwork programming assignments. 
Unless you are involved in research, these computers in the instructional labs are the only machines you will be able to use. 
If you do become involved in research with a faculty member she may decide to give you access to her machines. 
You can check out the Lab Hour and Lab Equipment for more information.
 Expiration - Expiration dates for accounts are taken from enrollment data provided by the Registrar. When an account is about to expire, an automated email notice is sent. 
                    
                  In the normal course of events, if you are a Bren School major your account will be automatically extended and you will never see such messages. 
                  
                  Non-Bren School majors will receive these messages as their accounts are opened and closed each quarter depending on course enrollment. If you continue to enroll in a Bren School course, your account will reactivate automatically.
                  
                  If the Registrar does not list you, or you fail to enroll on time, you will be sent one of these notices. If you receive a notice in error, contact  helpdesk@ics.uci.edu.
Quotas - Your quota is the amount of disk space you are allowed to use. Undergraduate students get a quota of 100 MB. For information on how to check your quota, please see Account Quota.
Please Note - When contacting support, please include your Bren School login and student ID number to facilitate the processing of your request. If you change your name or student ID number, you need to notify  helpdesk@ics.uci.edu. Otherwise, your account may be automatically locked or your quota removed because of the way the registrar's system works. 
For general information about what support offers undergraduate students see  Student Information.

Remote Access


Computer systems maintained by the both the UCI Office of Information Technology and Bren School computing support accept connections only from systems which have ther names correctly registered in Domain Name System (DNS). See?OIT's Limitation of Services to non-registered hosts for more details on this policy. 
For security reasons, Bren School systems always reject connections from remote hosts which do not have matching forward and reverse DNS entries. If you are having trouble telnet'ing or ftp'ing to a Bren School system while away from UCI this may be the cause of the problem.

Undergraduate Student Policies




Academic Standing
Students' academic status is reviewed on a quarterly basis. Academic standing is determined by GPA and degree progress. To stay in good standing:
Maintain a quarterly and cumulative GPA above 2.0, andMake progress towards your chosen degree
The Student Affairs Office will notify the student of their academic probation status via their UCI email account.? The letter will include an academic probation contract.? The contract will outline specific conditions that must be met in order to return to good academic standing.
It is the student¡¯s responsibility to:
manage their UCI accountto read and respond to official messages from their academic counselors in a timely manner.monitor academic progress and maintain good academic standing.
Failure to follow through on the steps outlined in your academic probation letter will result in an administrative hold on the student¡¯s record.
Student should contact their academic counselor soon after receiving the academic probation notification to ensure their upcoming course load is reasonable and to learn about helpful campus resources.
?

?
? Academic Probation
Students are subject to probation any time their quarterly or cumulative GPA falls below 2.0, or if they have violated one or more terms of the academic probation contract they are currently on.
**If a student¡¯s term or cumulative GPA falls below a 1.5, the student will be dismissed from the Donald Bren School of ICS effective immediately.? This policy applies to full-time and part-time students.

? Academic Probation Stages
Academic Probation 1
-AP 1 results if the student¡¯s term or cumulative GPA falls below a 2.0.
-Student will be placed on an academic probation contract for the following quarter.
Academic Probation 2 / Subject to Disqualification
-AP 2 results if the student is on two consecutive quarters of academic probation, or has not met one or more terms of the academic probation 1 contract.?
-Student is subject to disqualification
-Student is given the opportunity to appeal the possible / pending disqualification status
*Please note that being subject to disqualification is NOT the same as being formally disqualified

? Submitting a Letter of Appeal
A letter of appeal should explain any unusual or extenuating circumstances that contributed to the student's academic difficulties.? It must also detail the student's plans and actions for effectively addressing these circumstances (including the use of campus resources) so student can return to good academic standing.
The Associate Dean will carefully review the student's appeal letter, transcript and academic file with the academic counselors before making a decision. ?Note that the Associate Dean for Student Affairs is the chief academic officer for the Bren School of ICS, and his decisions regarding disqualification appeals are final.
If the appeal is granted, the student will be held to an academic contract that outlines the expectations and timeframe for returning to good academic standing.
If the appeal is denied, the student will be formally disqualified from the major, the Bren School of ICS, and UC Irvine. ?
*Instructions on how to appeal, including deadline and where to send the letter will be indicated in the student¡¯s academic probation letter.

? Disqualification
If a student is formally disqualified, he or she will be restricted from registering for courses or using university services after a stated date. The Registrar's Office will also be instructed to note the effective date of the disqualification on the student's official transcript.? An official letter will be sent to the student's permanent address on file.
It is recommended for the student to see an academic counselor to learn about the readmission process and policy.

? Readmission
If a student has been formally disqualified, the student is encouraged to make an appointment to speak with an academic counselor to learn about the readmission policy and to strategize future plans and goals. Please visit the page on Withdrawal and Readmission for additional information.
If / when the student readmits to ICS after having been academically disqualified, the student must for the first quarter of return earn a 2.0 term GPA and Cs or higher in each course.? Failure to meet these terms may result in academic probation or being subject to disqualification.

                Overview
                
			      Welcome to the homepage of Sherlock@UCI: a UC Irvine project on Entity Resolution and Data Quality!
 				  	

                  
					
				  The significance of data quality research is motivated by the observation that 
					the effectiveness of data-driven technologies such as decision support tools,
                  data exploration, analysis, and scientific discovery tools is closely tied to the
                  quality of data on which such techniques are applied. It is well recognized
                  that the outcome of the analysis is only as good as the data on which
                  the analysis is performed. That is why today organizations spend a tangible
                  percent of their budgets on cleaning tasks such as removing duplicates,
                  correcting errors, filling missing values, to improve data quality prior
                  to pushing data through the analysis pipeline.
                  
                  Given the critical importance of the problem, many efforts, in both industry
                  and academia, have explored systematic approaches to addressing the cleaning
                  challenges. The work of our group focuses primarily on the entity resolution challenge
                  that arises because objects in the real world are referred to using references
                  or descriptions that are not always unique identifiers of the objects,
                  leading to ambiguity.
                  
                  The traditional approach for entity resolution uses features associated with
                  a reference (or a record) to find references that co-refer. In our project we are exploring
                  which other sources and types of information could be used, in addition to features, to better
                  disambiguate among references. This information could be present in that data being cleaned itself
                  or can be obtained from external data sources, including ontologies, encyclopedias, and the Web.
                  We are also looking into ways to guide and fine-tune the data cleaning process based
                  on the type of analysis that will be done on the data being cleaned for it to reach higher
                  disambiagution quality as well as efficiency.
				 	
				  
                  Past Work
                

                  As part of our project, in the past we have pioneered a novel entity resolution methodology which we refer to as
                  Relationship-Based Data Cleaning (RelDC). RelDC relies upon the observation that many real-world
                  datasets are relational in nature
                  and contain not only information about entities but also relationships among them,
                  knowledge of which can be used to disambiguate among representations more effectively.
                  RelDC is a principled, domain-independent framework that
                  exploits the entity-relationship graph of the dataset, and specifically
                  relationships, for high-quality entity resolution that is self-tuning and requires minimal
                  intervention by analysts.

Overview





Advances in processor and wireless networking technology are
generating a new class of distributed, real-time, and embedded (DRE) systems, useful in a range
of application domains such as
avionics, biomedical devices and telemedicine, remote sensing, space exploration and command and
control. 
Developing applications for such complex DRE systems has grown not only difficult, but also
challenging in the need to satisfy performance and reliability constraints while ensuring
efficient exploration through a very large architectural design and implementation space.
The development process for these systems continue to be manually driven; the design of complex
systems is often extremely platform specific along the process, which make the resulting system
design inflexible and non-reusable.

The FORGE project is a framework for optimization of distributed embedded systems software,
with the goal of overcoming the above mentioned challenges. We integrate the middleware abstraction
layer with the hardware/OS abstraction layer and study mechanisms for capturing resources/architectures at these two levels and allowing interactions between the levels.

			  Abstract 
			  Chinese Pinyin input methods are very important for Chinese language
				 processing. In many cases, users may make typing errors. For example, a user wants to type
				 in "shenme" (Ê²Ã´, meaning "what" in English) but may type in "shenem" instead.
				 Existing Pinyin input methods fail in converting such a Pinyin sequence with errors
				 to the right Chinese words. To solve this problem, we developed an efficient error-tolerant
				 Pinyin input method called "CHIME" that can handle typing errors. By incorporating state-of-the-art
				 techniques and language-specific features, the method achieves a better performance
				 than state-of-the-art input methods. It can efficiently find relevant words
				 in milliseconds for an input Pinyin sequence.			  
			
			
			  Framework
                          For an input Pinyin sequence with typing errrors, CHIME works in three steps:
                          Detect mistyped Pinyins that are not included in the predefined Pinyin dictionary.
			  For each mistyped Pinyin, CHIME find top-k similar candidate Pinyins.
			  CHIME converts the corrected Pinyin sequence to the most likely sequence of Chinese words.

The FLAMINGO Project on Data Cleaning
Department of Computer Science, UC Irvine


Objective

 The Flamingo Project focuses on data cleaning, i.e., how to
deal with errors and inconsistencies in information systems.  As an
example, in many applications such as data integration, commercial
organizations need to collect data from various sources to conduct
analysis and make decisions. Often, the data from these different
sources can have inconsistencies. For instance, we use first name,
last name, SSN, and birthday to identify a person. However, the same
name, e.g., "Schwarzenegger", may be misspelled as "Swarzzengaer" or
other forms. Such errors make it more challenging to link records from
different places and answer queries approximately.  We are developing
algorithms in order to make query answering and information retrieval
efficient in the presence of such inconsistencies and errors.

With the NSF
award IIS-0844574,
we plan to study the following problems.  Supporting fuzzy queries is
becoming increasingly more important in applications that need to deal
with a variety of data inconsistencies in structures, representations,
or semantics.  Many existing algorithms require an offline analysis of
data sets to construct an efficient index structure to support online
query processing. Fuzzy join queries of data sets are more time
consuming due to the computational complexity.  The PI is studying
three research problems: (1) constructing high-quality inverted lists
for fuzzy search queries using Hadoop; (2) supporting fuzzy joins of
large data sets using Hadoop; and (3) using the developed techniques
to improve data quality of large collections of documents.

With the NSF
award 1030002,
we will study how to support powerful keyword search with efficient
indexing structures and algorithms in a clouding-computing
infrastructure. A main application is supporting
family reunification in disasters
such as the Haiti Earthquake.  Check our portals for
the Haiti Earthquake
and Chile Earthquake.  The
main challenge is how to use limited programming primitives in the
cloud to implement index structures and search algorithms.

              SpeakerTodd Walter, TeradataTitleTeradata Past, Present and FutureAbstractIn the early 1980's, Teradata Corporation
                  introduced the world's first commercial
                  shared-nothing parallel database management
                  system. Today, Teradata manages many of the
                  world's largest data warehouses. A look at
                  Teradata's past will show how parallelism was
                  applied over a wide variety of generations of
                  hardware and business challenges. Then we will
                  look at the key differentiators of the product as
                  they exist today and where the product may go in
                  the future. Customer examples will be used
                  throughout.Speaker BioTodd Walter joined Teradata in 1987. He
                  designed and implemented features of Teradata,
                  managed engineering teams and researched advanced
                  database topics. Todd has worked directly with
                  many customers at the leading edge of adopting
                  data warehouse technology, guiding the technology
                  to solve real business problems. He holds several
                  Teradata patents and in 1998 was named Teradata
                  Fellow, the highest technical award granted by
                  the company. In his current role as Chief
                  Technical Officer of Teradata R&D, Todd is
                  responsible for vision, strategy and technical
                  leadership, taking Teradata into the future.

                  This talk will first outline the history of
                  Hadoop and of the Map/Reduce framework which
                  inspired it. It will then describe the Hadoop
                  execution model and distributed filesystem.
                  Finally, it will discuss practical applications
                  of Hadoop, illustrated by specific examples from

                  Scientist, Yahoo!TitlePig: Building High-Level Dataflows over
                  Map-ReduceAbstractInternet companies routinely capture and
                  analyze large data sets, using the obtained
                  insights to guide product design. For such large
                  data analysis, programmers have flocked to the
                  Map-Reduce programming model that is simple,
                  scalable, and at the same time, extremely
                  versatile. The explicit dataflow programming
                  style of Map-Reduce is preferred by many over the
                  high-level declarative style of SQL. However, the
                  map-reduce paradigm is too low-level and rigid,
                  leaving the users to write a lot of custom code
                  for common operations such as filter, join etc,
                  and for dealing with multi-step and branching
                  dataflows. Such custom code is hard to reuse and
                  maintain, and also impedes optimizations. I will
                  talk about the design and implementation of Pig:
                  a high-level dataflow system that aims at a
                  sweet-spot between the declarative style of SQL
                  and the procedural style of Map-Reduce. Pig
                  offers SQL-style high-level data
                  manipulation constructs, which can be assembled
                  in an explicit dataflow and interleaved with
                  custom Map- and Reduce-style functions or
                  executables. Pig programs are compiled into
                  sequences of Map-Reduce jobs, and executed in the
                  Hadoop Map-Reduce environment. Both Pig and
                  Hadoop are open-source projects administered by
                  the Apache Software Foundation.

                  management systems. On the other hand, they
                  typically are able to trade off consistency to
                  achieve their goals. This has led to the
                  development of specialized key-value stores,
                  which are now used widely in virtually every
                  large-scale web service. On the other hand, most
                  web services also require capabilities such as
                  indexing provided by a DBMS. We are witnessing an
                  evolution of data serving as systems builders
                  seek to balance these trade-offs. In this talk, I
                  will survey some of the solutions that have been
                  developed, including Amazon's S3 and SimpleDB and
                  Yahoo!'s PNUTS, and discuss the challenges in
                  building such systems as "cloud services",
                  providing elastic data serving capacity to
                  developers, along with appropriately balanced
                  consistency, availability, performance and
                  partition tolerance.Speaker BioRaghu Ramakrishnan is Chief Scientist for

              SpeakerJingren Zhou, Researcher, MicrosoftTitleSCOPE: Parallel Data Processing of Massive
                  Data SetsAbstractCompanies providing cloud-scale services have
                  an increasing need to store and analyze massive
                  data sets such as search logs and click streams.
                  For cost and performance reasons, processing is
                  typically done on large clusters of
                  shared-nothing commodity machines. It is
                  imperative to develop a programming model that
                  hides the complexity of the underlying system but
                  provides flexibility by allowing users to extend
                  functionality to meet a variety of requirements.
                  In this talk, we present a new declarative and
                  extensible scripting language, SCOPE (Structured
                  Computations Optimized for Parallel Execution),
                  targeted for this type of massive data analysis
                  at Microsoft. The language is designed for ease
                  of use with no explicit parallelism, while being
                  amenable to efficient parallel execution on large
                  clusters. SCOPE borrows several features from
                  SQL. Data is modeled as sets of rows composed of
                  typed columns. The select statement is retained
                  with inner joins, outer joins, and aggregation
                  allowed. Users can easily define their own
                  functions and implement their own versions of
                  operators: extractors (parsing and constructing
                  rows from a file), processors (row-wise
                  processing), reducers (group-wise processing),
                  and combiners (combining rows from two inputs).
                  SCOPE supports nesting of expressions but also
                  allows a computation to be specified as a series
                  of steps, in a manner often preferred by
                  programmers. We also describe how scripts are
                  compiled and optimized into efficient, parallel
                  execution plans and executed on large
                  clusters.

              SpeakerMatthias Nicola, DB2 pureXML Architect,
                  IBMTitleScalable Data Management with DB2AbstractEnterprises around the world are relying on
                  DB2 for scalable data management such as
                  transaction processing applications and data
                  warehousing. This presentation provides an
                  overview of two scalability concepts that DB2
                  offers: the DB2 database partitioning feature
                  (DPF) and DB2 pureScale. DB2's database
                  partitioning feature provides users with a
                  parallel database system in a shared-nothing
                  architecture. More computing nodes can be added
                  to the DPF system to meet growing demands in
                  terms of data volume and workload. We will
                  discuss the data partitioning and placement
                  options as well as query processing concepts in a
                  DPF database. We will also examine the setup and
                  results of a recent scalability benchmark for
                  complex XML query processing in a DB2 partitioned
                  database. Contrary to the warehousing focus of
                  DPF, the DB2 pureScale technology provides a
                  parallel and scalable solution for online
                  transaction processing applications. We provide
                  an overview of the shared-disk architecture and
                  transaction processing concepts in DB2
                  pureScale.Speaker BioMatthias Nicola is a senior engineer for DB2
                  pureXML at IBM's Silicon Valley Lab. His work
                  focuses on all aspects of XML in DB2, including
                  XQuery, SQL/XML, XML storage, indexing and
                  performance. Matthias also works closely with
                  customers and business partners, assisting them
                  in the design, implementation, and optimization
                  of XML solutions. He is a co-author of the /DB2
                  pureXML Cookbook/. Prior to joining IBM, Matthias
                  worked on data warehousing performance for
                  Informix Software, focusing on query
                  optimization, star join processing, high-speed
                  data loading, and other features. In 1999,
                  Matthias received a Ph.D. in computer science

                  Santa BarbaraTitleData in the Cloud: New Challenges or More of the
                  Same?AbstractOver the past two decades, database and systems
                  researchers have made significant advances in the
                  development of algorithms and techniques to provide
                  data management solutions that carefully balance the
                  three major requirements when dealing with critical
                  data: high availability, scalability, and data
                  consistency. However, over the past few years the
                  data requirements, in terms of availability and
                  scalability, from Internet scale enterprises that
                  provide services and cater to millions of users has
                  been unprecedented. Current proposed solutions to
                  scalable data management, driven primarily by
                  prevalent application requirements, significantly
                  downplay the data consistency requirements and
                  instead focus on very high availability and almost
                  unlimited scalability to support data-rich
                  applications for millions to tens of millions of
                  users. In particular, the "newer" data management
                  systems limit consistent access only at the
                  granularity of single objects, rows, or keys,
                  thereby significantly trading-off consistency in
                  order to achieve very high scalability and
                  availability. But the growing popularity of "cloud
                  computing", the resulting shift of a large number of
                  Internet applications to the cloud, and the quest
                  towards providing data management services in the
                  cloud, has opened up the challenge for designing
                  data management systems that provide consistency
                  guarantees at a granularity which goes beyond single
                  rows and keys. In this talk, we analyze the design
                  choices that allowed modern scalable data management
                  systems to achieve orders of magnitude higher levels
                  of scalability compared to traditional
                  databases. With this understanding, we highlight
                  some design principles for data management systems
                  providing scalable and consistent data management as
                  a service in the cloud. We conclude the talk by
                  presenting results from two prototype systems which
                  strike a middle-ground between the two radically
                  different data management architectures: traditional
                  database management systems where the data is
                  treated as a "whole" versus modern key-value stores
                  where data is treated as a collection of independent
                  "granules".Speaker BioDr. Divy Agrawal serves on the faculty of

              Speaker Chris Olston, Research Scientist, Yahoo!TitleProgramming and Debugging Large-Scale Data Processing WorkflowsAbstractThis talk gives an overview of some work on large-scale data processing I have done with my Yahoo collaborators. The first half describes two data processing systems I helped develop: PIG, a dataflow programming environment and Hadoop-based runtime, and NOVA, a workflow manager for Pig/Hadoop. The second half focuses on debugging, and looks at what can be done before, during and after execution of a data processing operation:
  * Pig's automatic EXAMPLE DATA GENERATOR is used before running a Pig job to get a feel for what it will do, enabling certain kinds of mistakes to be caught early and cheaply. The algorithm behind the example generator performs a combination of sampling and synthesis to balance several key factors---realism, conciseness and completeness---of the example data it produces.
  * INSPECTOR GADGET is a framework for creating custom tools that monitor Pig job execution. We have implemented a dozen user-requested tools, ranging from data integrity checks to crash cause investigation to performance profiling, each in just a few hundreds of lines of code.
  * IBIS is a system that collects metadata about what happened during data processing, for post-hoc analysis. The metadata is collected from multiple sub-systems (e.g. Nova, Pig, Hadoop) that deal with data and processing elements at different granularities (e.g. tables vs. records; relational operators vs. reduce task attempts) and offer disparate ways of querying it. IBIS integrates this metadata and presents a uniform and powerful query interface to users.Speaker BioChristopher Olston is a principal research scientist at Yahoo!

        	Overview
            Welcome to the new home of the AsterixDB Big Data Management
            System (BDMS). The AsterixDB BDMS is the result of about 3.5 years
            of R&D involving researchers at UC Irvine, UC Riverside, and UC San
            Diego. The AsterixDB code base now consists of roughly 250K lines
            of Java code that has been co-developed at UC Irvine and UC
            Riverside.
            
            Initiated in 2009, the NSF-sponsored ASTERIX project has been
            developing new technologies for ingesting, storing, managing,
            indexing, querying, and analyzing vast quantities of
            semi-structured information. The project has been combining ideas
            from three distinct areas¡ªsemi-structured data, parallel databases,
            and data-intensive computing (a.k.a. today¡¯s Big Data platforms)¡ªin
            order to create a next-generation, open-source software platform
            that scales by running on large, shared-nothing commodity computing
            clusters.

            The ASTERIX effort has been targeting a wide range of
            semi-structured information, ranging from ¡°data¡± use cases¡ªwhere
            information is well-typed and highly regular¡ªto ¡°content¡± use
            cases¡ªwhere data tends to be irregular, much of each datum may be
            textual, and the ultimate schema for the various data types
            involved may be hard to anticipate up front. The ASTERIX project
            has been addressing technical issues including highly scalable data
            storage and indexing, semi-structured query processing on very
            large clusters, and merging time-tested parallel database
            techniques with modern data-intensive computing techniques to
            support performant yet declarative solutions to the problem of
            storing and analyzing semi-structured information effectively.
            
            The first fruits of this labor have been captured in the
            AsterixDB system that is now being released in preliminary or
            ¡°Beta¡± release form. We are hoping that the arrival of AsterixDB
            will mark the beginning of the ¡°BDMS era¡±, and we hope that both
            the Big Data community and the database community will find the
            AsterixDB system to be interesting and useful for a much broader
            class of problems than can be addressed with any one of today¡¯s
            current Big Data platforms and related technologies (e.g., Hadoop,
            Pig, Hive, HBase, MongoDB, and so on). One of our project mottos
            has been ¡°one size fits a bunch¡±¡ªat least that has been our
            aim.

      Motivation
      
      
        Today, efficient data processing is a fundamental and vital issue
		for almost every scientific, academic, or business organization. Therefore the organizations
		end up installing and managing database management systems to satisfy different data processing
		needs. Although it is possible to purchase the necessary hardware, deploy database products,
		establish network connectivity, and hire the professional people who run the system, as a
		traditional solution, this  has been getting increasingly expensive and impractical as
		the database systems and problems become larger and more complicated. 
        
        Advances in the networking technologies have triggered one of the key industry responses, the
		"software as a service" initiative, also referred to as the application service provider (ASP) model.
		To address the above-stated problem, "Database as a service" model inherits all the advantages of the
		ASP model, indeed even more, given that a large number of organizations have their own DBMSs. The model
		allows organizations to leverage hardware and software solutions provided by the service providers,
		without having to develop them on their own, thereby freeing them to concentrate on their core businesses.        


      Overview
      The objective of this research is to explore viability of database-as-a-service (DAS) model. The first step towards that objective, we feel is implementation and provisioning of such a service. The primary challenge posed by the DAS model is the issue of data privacy. In the database-service-provider model, user's data resides on the premises of the provider. Both corporations and individuals view their data as a very valuable asset. A service provider would need to implement sufficient security measures to guarantee data privacy. One key issue is how much privacy is enough? Clearly, protection from hackers who might break into the service provider's system is required. However, we argue that this is not enough since clients will also desire privacy protection from service providers themselves. Any data privacy solution will have to utilize encryption which, as usual, comes with a certain cost. A fundamental question is whether encryption is too costly thus making the database service provider model infeasible.Our research investigates various aspects of this challenge by devising new techniques, which ensure the privacy of the data. With the above general goals, we are conducting research along the following directions:
      
      
         Implementation and provisioning of Database-as-a-Service Model. To build a better understanding of the challenges introduced by DAS model, an instantiation of the model should be implemented and deployed with the usage of real clients.
           Integration of data encryption with database systems to protect data against outside malicious attacks and to limit the liability of the service provider. Data encryption is a solution to ensure the privacy of the data in the databases against adversaries. However, encryption techniques have significant performance implications on query processing in databases. Alternatives for integrating encryption techniques with databases should be investigated and trade-offs should be made. Developing mathematical and statistical measures of Data Privacy for various privacy preserving schemes. 
         Development of techniques to protect the privacy of user data from the database service providers themselves. If the service providers themselves are not trusted, the protecting the privacy of users' data is much more challenging issue. Research should be conducted to address this challenge in the following directions:
               Design of new data storage model. An encrypted data storage model should be designed. The model should enable query processing directly over encrypted databases to ensure the privacy from database providers.
                 Development of new query processing techniques. Based on the encrypted data storage model, novel query processing techniques need to be developed. Those techniques allow query processing directly over encrypted data thereby hiding the information from the service providers. Decryption is performed only by the client, who is the rightful owner of the data.
                 Development of new techniques for special query types. Some specific query classes particularly introduce challenges in encrypted database environments. Typical examples for those are aggregation queries and text pattern matching queries. Widely used encryption techniques fail to provide capabilities to support such query types. However, if those query types are not handled specifically; they introduce very significant performance overheads sometimes even jeopardizing the feasibility of the system. Therefore, first, techniques need to be adapted and/or devised to support those types of queries, and second, query processing techniques, which make use of those techniques, have to be developed.
          
         Query optimization in encrypted databases. New techniques changes the way we process queries over encrypted databases. Thus, optimization of these reformulated queries has to be carefully studied. The optimization process should ensure that the users of the system, the clients, can take full advantage of the capabilities promised by DAS model.  Integrity of the data in encrypted databases. Once data encryption is employed as a solution to data privacy problem, there are other issues in this context. One of the most important of those is ensuring the integrity of the users' data. As a result of both malicious and non-malicious causes the integrity of the data may be compromised. When this happens, the client does not have any mechanism to detect the integrity of the original data. Therefore, new techniques have to be developed to provide clients mechanisms to check the integrity of their data hosted at the service provider side.Key management issues in encrypted databases. Another issue to address in the context of encrypted databases is key management. All encryption techniques rely on secure and efficient key management architectures. DAS model puts additional complexity on key management architectures. Generation, registration, storage, and update of encryption keys are essential functions that have to be handled efficiently in DAS model.

Course Information
To Make a Short Story Long

In 1970, Tedd Codd came down from Data Mountain and gave us the stone tablets containing the relational data model. The systems research that took place over the decade that followed revolutionized the world of database management and brought us the high-level database management systems that we all know and love today. In particular, it moved the database programmers of the world from working a record at a time, imperatively, to working a query at a time, declaratively. This was made possible due to the model and its high-level languages, like SQL (and Quel), which made query optimization possible and enabled a separation of physical and logical database design as development activities. This led to unprecedented productivity gains in database application development, gave birth to a multi-billion-dollar industry, and remains history's greatest example of the benefits of declarative high-level languages.


As the demand for relational storage, query response times, and transaction throughput increased, the relational model also enabled an architectural revolution. In the early 1980's, database systems researchers realized that hash-based data partitioning and "shared-nothing" clusters of computers (known then as "massively parallel processors" or MPP systems) could be used to deliver high-performance, scalable implementations of the relational model.  Much activity followed on topics including partitioned storage and indexing, parallel runtime architectures, parallel implementations of operators such as joins and aggregation, and optimization of parallel queries. Successful commercial systems appeared, including such industry leaders as Teradata (for parallel queries) and Tandem (for parallel transactions) as well as offerings from more traditional vendors such as IBM (DB2). Having limited attention spans, database researchers tired of this area in the mid-1990's and wandered off to work on other things such as data mining, OLAP, and other trendier issues. Fast foward to today, and there is a flurry of new startup activity in this space but no flurry of research (yet) to match. The importance of this area, and its impact on the research and development communities, is born out by the fact that two major ACM awards went to leaders of the two most ground-breaking research projects in this area from the early 1990s's -- namely Gamma (ACM Software Systems Award) and GRACE (ACM SIGMOD E.F. Codd Innovations Award).


In parallel (pun intended) with what the database community was doing, the software systems (distributed systems, OS, and programming languages) community was also at work. Parallel computing for MPPs first emerged as a focus area in the late 1970's. (E.g., the instructor of this course earned his MS degree by writing and measuring message-passing programs for a 50-node MPP in 1980-81). When the new millenium started, various programming models and languages had been tried, but parallel programming was still an elusively painful process. In the early 2000's Google, driven by an ever-increasing mass of web and clickstream data, more money than they knew what to do with from advertising, and larger clusters than most "normal" companies had assembled in the past, identified the need for a change. The MapReduce paradigm -- your Map function goes here, your Reduce function goes there, we do the rest -- was born. MapReduce parallelism was based on hash-based data partitioning. Data analysts whose brains were suitably wired for this way of thinking discovered that this was a relatively easy path to developing scalable analytical programs that could effectively utilize 100's or even 1000's of nodes in order to analyze very large data sets. Open source innovation followed, and today we have an ever-growing MapReduce craze founded on Hadoop (open source MapReduce) and HDFS (its underlying file system, an open source Google file system lookalike). Also in parallel, developers at the Big Web Companies such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook -- faced with the need to provide fast "point query" access to large data sets like user profiles -- have moved away from using relational databases and instead towards building/using scalable key-value stores that partition data across clusters and provide simple lookup APIs. Gone are schemas, queries, and serializability; instead we have key-value objects, lookups, and eventual consistency.


Today, these two worlds are converging (or colliding, depending on your point of view, leading to Codd's stone tablets being in pieces on the floor). Both communities have recognized the similarities between what they are doing -- e.g., hash-based data partitioning, shared-nothing clusters -- and are adopting ideas from the other. In database-land, researchers are moving to apply "database techniques" and "database thinking" to improve the arguably simplistic (but effective) state of the art (represented by systems like Hadoop) while still supporting the same class of applications. In software-systems-land, researchers are working to raise the level of abstraction provided to programmers. In both cases, research groups are looking at layering higher-level languages and primitives on top of the foundation that MapReduce provides as well as alternative implementation techniques that can be utilized in the underlying infrastructure - and/or at layering more database-like capabilities on top of key-value stores. In both communities, researchers are interested in the issues raised by very large clusters, often located in the "cloud" (hosted by a computing service provider, e.g., Amazon) and with a time-varying set of resources and workloads. Terms such as data-intensive computing and cloud computing are appearing everywhere, and nearly everyone is feeling obligated to explain why what they are working on applies to these areas and their challenges.


And along came ASTERIX...! At UCI, we are currently investigating what we, without bias of course, believe to be "the right answer" to future data management needs.  Our ASTERIX project is combining ideas from parallel databases, semistructured data management, and data-intensive computing technologies to create a fully-featured, next-generation information management and analysis platforms (with reusable components). As I type these words one week before our first class meeting, the graduate students in the ASTERIX project are busting their ASTERIXes in order to deliver a version of the system for use in this class.

Course Description

In this course, students will review the current state of the art in data-intensive computing and then focus on doing a project of their choosing related to the field. The course will begin with some initial all-hands reading, lectures, and perhaps exercises involving MapReduce and Hadoop as well as UCI's own ASTERIX software. Students will then spend the bulk of the course taking a much deeper dive into some particular aspect of data-intensive computing that interests them. Students from fields like machine learning or social science may wish to explore the application of data-intensive computing techniques to problems in their area; students interested in programming languages may choose to compare (hands-on!) several alternative data-intensive languages and/or platforms; students interested in data management techniques may wish to benchmark new storage technologies (e.g., some of the emerging "NoSQL stores") or to spend the quarter working as an extension of the ASTERIX development team by adding new types and functions, operators, and/or storage features to the ASTERIX/Hyracks platform under development at UCI.

Nature of Course

The course will begin with some shared all-hands readings and level-setting lectures by the instructors. It will then quickly proceed to its steady state, wherein the weekly class meeting will involve a mix of student talks, project status reports, and small group meetings. Each student will be expected to read and present one of the papers from the instructor-provided reading list and to teach its content (i.e., its main ideas and contributions) to the class. This is a project class, and to make sure most of each student's time is focused on their project work, we will not be expecting everyone to read all of the papers. Instead, when it's your turn to teach, you will be asked to focus your presentation on an audience whose ONLY exposure to the paper will be your talk. If you are interested in a particular paper that someone else is teaching, you are welcome to read it on your own time. Project-wise, it is expected that students will spend at least ten hours per week on their projects - i.e., that your projects will be 100-hour projects with suitably impressive outcomes. (If this sounds scary, this may not be the course for you. If this sounds fun, you are in the right place.)


Paper-reading deliverables will include your oral presentation and a nicely-formatted slide deck that can be posted on the course Web site.


Project deliverables will include running high-quality project code (with an ASTERIX team member's signoff), a live demonstration, and a final project report (both written as well as presented orally at the end of the quarter). Design and implementation quality will count heavily in the project grades; throw-away efforts will not be well-received (:-)). You will also be expected to provide weekly status information to the instructors on what you've accomplished in the past week and what you have planned for the week ahead; this will be done by creating and maintaining a project wiki page that is updated at least weekly by the end of the day on Wednesdays. The instructors will also make themselves available for project-related consultations during the latter part of each week's class time (after the talks are over).

Prerequisites

This course is aimed at advanced graduate students who are ready (and wanting) to do interesting hands-on projects related to data-intensive computing technologies. A graduate-level course in database management systems, e.g., CS 222/223, is highly recommended, and it is expected that most students will be second-year or beyond students. Exceptions will be made for students who come either with comparable experience from elsewhere, with previous experience involving data-intensive computing, or with a strong background in an application area (e.g., machine learning, social science, advanced algorithms, scientific computing) and a desire to explore the application of data-intensive computing tools (such as ASTERIX) to their problem domain.

Grading Breakdown

Class Participation: 10%  In-Class Lecture: 20%  Course Project: 70%

The Fine Print

Neither of the instructors of this class are doing this for any reason other than fun and an opportunity to expose a group of bright young guinea pigs to data-intensive computing technologies, particularly ASTERIX. (I.e., this is a self-inflicted voluntary "overload" assignment for both of us.) Please keep that in mind as the course unfolds. :-)


Course Schedule

The meeting-by-meeting reading list is given below. The instructors will cover the first week's readings; students will do the rest of the presenting.  With one or two exceptions, we will have two student lectures per class (during the first half of the class).

Motivation

Many emerging applications such as multimedia digital libraries, medical
image databases require accessing multimedia information based on their
content. Traditional text based information retrieval techniques do not
suffice due to the complexity of capturing visual content using textual
description and the high degree of human effort in developing the suitable
descriptions. An alternative approach is to describe images/videos based
on visual properties (such as color, texture, and shape) and support retrieval
based on these features. Such an approach to visual information retrieval
requires interdisciplinary research in the areas of image processing and
computer vision (to extract salient features from the visual media that
capture its content), information retrieval (to define a notion of similarity
between multimedia objects), and database management (to support efficient
storage of multimedia objects and retrieval based on the degree of match).
Our research addresses the information retrieval and database management
challenges in content-based multimedia retrieval.


Overview

The goals of the MARS project is to design and develop an integrated multimedia
information retrieval and database management infrastructure, entitled
Multimedia Analysis and Retrieval System (MARS), that supports multimedia
information as first-class objects suited for storage and retrieval based
on their content. Specifically, research in the MARS project is categorized
into the following four sub-areas each of which contribute to the development
of the integrated infrastructure.

 Multimedia Content Representation:
 
 extraction of multimedia content including low-level visual features from images, 
 shots and scenes from videos, textual annotations (user-provided or automatically extracted
 from videos). Content-based representation of multimedia objects in databases.
 Multimedia Information Retrieval:
 development of content-based multimedia retrieval techniques including 
 multimedia retrieval models and interactive query refinement techniques to map 
 user's high-level semantic queries to low-level feature based representations.
 Multimedia Feature Indexing:
 
 to efficiently support retrieval based on feature similarity. Techniques will be 
 developed for overcoming the high dimensionality and non-Euclidean nature of 
 feature data.
 Multimedia Database Management:
 
 techniques to effectively and efficiently incorporate content-based retrieval 
 of multimedia information into structured database processing. Exploration of 
 extensions to existing data models to support ranked retrieval and interactive query 
 refinement and approaches to integrate multimedia feature indexing techniques as access
 methods in database management systems. Study impact of ranked retrieval
 on query processing techniques.
 


Our work has focused on exploring techniques for multimedia object and
query representation, multimedia information retrieval, and developing
mechanisms for efficient indexing of highly multidimensional feature spaces.
Our progress can be categorized into the following:

 Video Representation: 
 
 Motivated with the role of a table of content (ToC) used in accessing a book, 
 we developed algorithms to structure a video into a set of scenes which represents 
 a video ToC. This ToC can be used to support effective user access (browsing and 
 retrieval) of video. We then explored a clustering based approach to extract key 
 frames from scenes identified in the video ToC. Some references
 (below) are: 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 13.
 Indexing Highly Multidimensional Spaces:
 
 We developed a hybrid tree data structure to support high-dimension feature indexing 
 in multimedia databases. The hybrid tree combines the positive aspects of bounding region
 (BR)-based data structures (e.g., R-tree, SS-tree) and space partitioning
 (SP) based approaches (e.g., KDB-tree, hB-tree) into a single search structure
 to achieve superior performance and scalability to high dimensionalities
 than either of the two approaches. Some references
 include (below): 1, and 18.
 Multimedia Information Retrieval:
 
 We made significant progress on multimedia information retrieval specially on adapting 
 relevance feedback as an approach to learning user's information need in image databases.
 With relevance feedback, the user is relieved of the burden to state their
 exact information need based on the feature sets supported in the system.
 Instead, the system learns both the query representation, and the distance/similarity
 measures that a user has in mind for the feature spaces using positive/negative
 feedback over examples from the user. Some references
 (below) are: 2,5, 6, 1.
 Supporting Multidimensional Data Structures as Access Methods:
 
 We have developed the first granular locking approach to concurrency control
 in multidimensional data structures. Our solution provides a scalable solution
 to integrating multidimensional data structures into DBMSs as an access
 method. Some references (below) are: 3, and 23.

2 What should I do if I get java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space in the Map phase of Stage 2, Kernel (ridpairsimproved or ridpairsppjoin)? 


Stage 1, Token Ordering (tokesbasic or tokensimproved) produces a
list of unique tokens that are loaded into memory by Stage 2. The list
is output in the tokens.n directory in HDFS. The reason for the
OutOfMemoryError might be the fact that the list of tokens does not
fit into memory.


The first thing you should check is whether you are using the right
tokenizer for your data. For example, if each join field value is a
list of words, then the word tokenizer would be
appropriate. Otherwise, if each join field value is a contiguous string
of characters, then a n-gram tokenizer might be appropriate. The
tokenizer can be specified in the command line with the
-Dfuzzyjoin.tokenizer= option or in the XML file specified with the
-conf option. For more details please see:




hadoop/fuzzyjoin/resources/conf/fuzzyjoin/default.xml








3 Where can I get more help?

you might have.

2 Overview 


This guide describes how to use the source code developed for the study in:




Efficient Parallel Set-Similarity Joins Using MapReduce.
Rares Vernica, Michael J. Carey, Chen Li
SIGMOD 2010 








3 Quick Start 


The only requirement for running the code is a Hadoop cluster. It does
not have to be a full-fledged cluster, a single-node
pseudo-distributed installation of Hadoop is enough. For more details
about starting a Hadoop cluster please see
http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/current/quickstart.html The code
works with Hadoop version 0.17 or higher.




3.1 Build 





$ cd fuzzyjoin-hadoop
fuzzyjoin-hadoop$ ant








3.2 Self-join 


Here are the steps to perform a self-join on a small sample of the
DBLP dataset. We use 100 DBLP entries, title and authors as the join
attributes, Jaccard similarity and a 0.5 similarity threshold.




3.2.1 Upload raw data 





fuzzyjoin-hadoop$ hadoop fs -put \
  ../data/dblp-small/raw-000 dblp-small/raw-000





The file dblp-small.raw.txt contains one record per line. On each
line the fields are separated by ":" and contain DBLP id,
publication title, authors (concatenated with " ") and other
information available about the publication (concatenated with " ").





3.2.2 Generate records 





fuzzyjoin-hadoop$ hadoop jar target/fuzzyjoin-hadoop-0.0.2.jar \
  recordbuild -conf src/main/resources/fuzzyjoin/dblp.quickstart.xml





This job assigns unique record-IDs to each record. The RIDs are
integers and are appended in front of each record. After this job,
each record contains five fields: RID, DBLP id, title, authors, other
information.





3.2.3 Balance records across nodes 





fuzzyjoin-hadoop$ hadoop jar target/fuzzyjoin-hadoop-0.0.2.jar \
  recordbalance -conf src/main/resources/fuzzyjoin/dblp.quickstart.xml





To skip this step, run:




fuzzyjoin-hadoop$ hadoop fs -mv \
  dblp-small/recordsbulk-000 dblp-small/records-000








3.2.4 Run set-similarity self-join 





fuzzyjoin-hadoop$ hadoop jar target/fuzzyjoin-hadoop-0.0.2.jar \
  fuzzyjoin -conf src/main/resources/fuzzyjoin/dblp.quickstart.xml





This will run the three stages required to do fuzzy joins: token
ordering (Tokens), kernel (RIDPairs), and record join
(RecordPairs). It will use the basic alternative for each stage. In
total it will run five Hadoop jobs (TokensBasic.phase1,
TokenBasic.phase2, RIDPairsImproved, RecordPairsBasic.phase1,
RecordPairsBasic.phase2).


Each stage can be run separately using different alternatives by
replacing fuzzyjoin in the above command with the name of the stage
and the alternative. For example, to run the one-phase token ordering
(TokensImproved), type:




fuzzyjoin-hadoop$ hadoop jar target/fuzzyjoin-hadoop-0.0.2.jar \
  tokensimproved -conf src/main/resources/fuzzyjoin/dblp.quickstart.xml





To get the list with all the available stages and alternatives, type:




fuzzyjoin-hadoop$ hadoop jar target/fuzzyjoin-hadoop-0.0.2.jar





To see the results, type:




fuzzyjoin-hadoop$ hadoop fs -cat "dblp-small/recordpairs-000/part-*"





Each line contains a pair of records that fuzzy join and their
similarity. The format of the line is record 1;threshold;record2,
where record1 and record2 have the same format as described in
step 3.






3.3 R-S join 


Here are the steps to perform a join between a small sample of the
DBLP dataset and a small sample of the CITESEERX dataset. We use 100
DBLP entries and 100 CITESEERX entries, title and authors as the join
attributes, Jaccard similarity and a 0.5 similarity threshold.




3.3.1 Upload raw data 





fuzzyjoin-hadoop$ hadoop fs -put \
  ../data/pub-small/raw.dblp-000 pub-small/raw.dblp-000
fuzzyjoin-hadoop$ hadoop fs -put \
  ../data/pub-small/raw.csx-000 pub-small/raw.csx-000





The raw directory contains two files, one for each dataset.





3.3.2 Generate records 





fuzzyjoin-hadoop$ hadoop jar target/fuzzyjoin-hadoop-0.0.2.jar \
  recordbuild -conf src/main/resources/fuzzyjoin/pub.quickstart.xml \
  -Dfuzzyjoin.data.suffix.input=dblp
fuzzyjoin-hadoop$ hadoop jar target/fuzzyjoin-hadoop-0.0.2.jar \
  recordbuild -conf src/main/resources/fuzzyjoin/pub.quickstart.xml \
  -Dfuzzyjoin.data.suffix.input=csx





Each job generates records for one of the datasets.





3.3.3 Balance records across nodes 





fuzzyjoin-hadoop$ hadoop jar target/fuzzyjoin-hadoop-0.0.2.jar \
  recordbalance -conf src/main/resources/fuzzyjoin/pub.quickstart.xml \
  -Dfuzzyjoin.data.suffix.input=dblp
fuzzyjoin-hadoop$ hadoop jar target/fuzzyjoin-hadoop-0.0.2.jar \
  recordbalance -conf src/main/resources/fuzzyjoin/pub.quickstart.xml \
  -Dfuzzyjoin.data.suffix.input=csx





To skip this step, run:




fuzzyjoin-hadoop$ hadoop fs -mv \
  pub-small/recordsbulk.dblp-000 pub-small/records.dblp-000
fuzzyjoin-hadoop$ hadoop fs -mv \
  pub-small/recordsbulk.csx-000 pub-small/records.csx-000








3.3.4 Run set-similarity join 





fuzzyjoin-hadoop$ hadoop jar target/fuzzyjoin-hadoop-0.0.2.jar \
  fuzzyjoin -conf src/main/resources/fuzzyjoin/pub.quickstart.xml





To see the results, type:




fuzzyjoin-hadoop$ hadoop fs -cat "pub-small/recordpairs-000/part-*"





Each line contains a pair of records that fuzzy join and their
similarity. The format of the line is
record-DBLP;threshold;record-CITESEERX, where record-DBLP and
record-CITESEERX have the same format as described in the self-join
case.







4 Configuration 


The XML files provided with the -conf argument above contain various
configuration parameters. Using the configuration parameters, a user
can specify the location of the data, the similarity function and
threshold, the join attributes and other settings. Moreover the user
can specify additional parameters in the command line using the -D
option.


The default parameters and more details about each parameter are in:




fuzzyjoin-hadoop/src/main/resources/fuzzyjoin/default.xml 





All these parameters and other constants are defined in:




fuzzyjoin-core/src/main/java/edu/uci/ics/fuzzyjoin/FuzzyJoinConfig.java
fuzzyjoin-hadoop/src/main/java/edu/uci/ics/fuzzyjoin/hadoop/FuzzyJoinDriver.java








5 Directory Structure and Tasks 


The following directory structure is used for self-joins:




|
|- raw-000
|- recordsbulk-000
|- recordsbulk-001
|- ...
|- records-000
|- records-001
|- ...
|- tokens-000
|- ...
|- tokens.phase1-000
|- ...
|- ridpairs-000
|- ...
|- recordpairs-000
|- ...
|- recordpairs.phase1-000
|- ...





The raw-000 directory contains the original files, one record per
line. The recordsbulk directory contains the original data where
each record starts with an integer RID. The number after the directory
name represents the copy number (000 is the original data, 001 is
the first copy, etc.). The records directory contains the same data
as the recordsbulk directory except that multiple copies are
aggregated and the data is balanced across nodes. The number after the
directory name represents how many copies are aggregated (000 is of
only one copy: recordsbulk-000, 001 is for two copies:
recordsbulk-000 and recordsbulk-001, etc.). So records-n
represents an increased dataset, where n denotes how many times the
dataset was increased. For the rest of the directories the number
after the directory name has the same meaning. The tokens directory
contains the list of tokens. The ridpairs directory contains the RID
pairs that fuzzy-join. The recordpairs directory contains the record
pairs that fuzzy-join. The phase1 prefix that appears for some
directories represents the output of the first MapReduce job for the
tasks with two MapReduce jobs (i.e., tokensbasic and
recordpairsbasic).


Bellow is a table with each task input and output directories:

TaskInputOutputrecordbuildrawrecordsbulkrecordbalancerecordsbulkrecordstokens basic/improvedrecordstokensridpairs improved/ppjoinrecords, tokensridpairsrecordpairs basic/improvedrecords, ridpairsrecordpairsrecordgeneraterecordsbulk-000, tokens-000recordsbulk



For R-S joins, the first few directories also carry the name of the
dataset (name of the R dataset or of the S dataset) in order to
differentiate between them:




|
|- raw.DATASET_R-000
|- raw.DATASET_S-000
|- recordsbulk.DATASET_R-000
|- recordsbulk.DATASET_R-001
|- ...
|- recordsbulk.DATASET_S-000
|- recordsbulk.DATASET_S-001
|- ...
|- records.DATASET_R-000
|- records.DATASET_R-001
|- ...
|- records.DATASET_S-000
|- records.DATASET_S-001
|- ...





where DATASET_R and DATASET_S are the names of the two
datasets. In our R-S join example we used dblp for DATASET_R and
csx for DATASET_S.






6 Dataset 


By default the dataset is assumed to have one record per line. The
fields of each record are delimited by ":". The first filed of each
record is an integer RID. This settings can be changed in:




fuzzyjoin-core/src/main/java/edu/uci/ics/fuzzyjoin/FuzzyJoinConfig.java





The dataset can be increased using the recordgenerate task:




fuzzyjoin-hadoop$ hadoop jar target/fuzzyjoin-hadoop-0.0.2.jar \
  recordgenerate -conf src/main/resources/fuzzyjoin/dblp.quickstart.xml \
  -Dfuzzyjoin.data.copy=10 \
  -Dfuzzyjoin.data.norecords=100





This stats 9 MapReduce jobs, each of them generating a new copy of
the dataset. The fuzzyjoin.data.copy parameter specifies the number
of times the dataset should be increased, while the
fuzzyjoin.data.norecords parameter specifies the number of records
in the original dataset (it is used to generate unique and
increasing RIDs). All the following tasks also need to have the same
value for the fuzzyjoin.data.copy parameter in order to use the
increased dataset. This task can only be ran after running
recordbuild and tokensbasic or tokensimproved on the original
dataset. After this task, the recordbuild task needs to be ran (it
cannot be skipped on the increased dataset):




fuzzyjoin-hadoop$ hadoop jar target/fuzzyjoin-hadoop-0.0.2.jar \
  recordbalance -conf src/main/resources/fuzzyjoin/dblp.quickstart.xml \
  -Dfuzzyjoin.data.copy=10
fuzzyjoin-hadoop$ hadoop jar target/fuzzyjoin-hadoop-0.0.2.jar \
  fuzzyjoin -conf src/main/resources/fuzzyjoin/dblp.quickstart.xml \
  -Dfuzzyjoin.data.copy=10

	Fuzzy Keyword Search on Spatial Data


	
	 
	The purpose of this demo is to show our solution on how to find relevant answers to mistyped spatial-keyword queries. It is built using the GeoNames geographical database which contains geographical objects (such as lakes and hills). We used the objects residing in the U.S., and the final dataset had about 1.8 million objects. The total data size was 100MB.

	Fuzzy Keyword Search on Spatial Data


	
	 
	The purpose of this demo is to show our solution on how to find relevant answers to mistyped spatial-keyword queries. It is built using a multimedia metadata collection extracted from Flickr pages, called CoPhIR Test Collection We processed the dataset to extract the photos taken in the U.S. based on their latitude and longitude values. Moreover, we used the keywords in the title, description, and tags of a photo as its textual attribute. The final dataset had about two million objects. Each record had a URL corresponding to the photo or a page including the photo. The total data size was about 400MB.

About ESL


		  
		The Experiential Systems Lab (ESL) at UC Irvine is part of the Department of Computer Science  within the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences.
		
		 
		After primarily dealing first with data and computing and then with information and communications, computing is now entering its third major phase of evolution dealing with insights and experiences. In this phase computing is coming closer to basic needs of humans. Experiential computing is computing dealing with experiences. Traditionally, computing works with data and uses operations and abstractions closer to data. Experiential computing must use abstractions and operations to go from data all the way to experiences that are closer to normal humans. Researchers in ESL are developing approaches towards bridging the semantic gap between computers and humans to realize experiential computing.

E2E Demos

	  Video 1 
	This video shows how the doctor's environment looks liks as he is connecting to the Remote Health Center.
 Especially watch out to see how the 2 video feeds change automatically change when the nurse and patient move from
 consulation room to the examination room and vice-versa. Also notice that display in monitor changes to show the
 patient's upper or lower body, depending on nurse's actions. Lastly notice the fusion of physical marker
 annotation on projected X-ray image.
 
 
   Video 2 
 This video shows what is happening in the Remote Health center as they interact with the doctor and move between  two environments.

The ICS Computing Labs are provided for students who are enrolled in
          ICS classes. Before you can begin using the computers in the labs, you
          must first obtain an ICS account. This section will help you with everything
          pertaining to the lab.

        The MSDN
          Academic Alliance helps provide software to students at no cost.
          For more information, please visit the MSDNAA FAQs page.
          If you already have an account, you can proceed to the login
          page.
        Password
        If you've forgotten your password, please see the Lab Assistant in
          CS364. You will be asked for your username and a form of picture ID.
        If you need to change your password, please go here.
          The page is only available from on-campus. If you're off-campus, please
          make sure that you're first connected via the UCI
          VPN.
        Turning in Assignments
        Assignments are turned in one of two ways: masterhit
          dropbox or checkmate.
          Please consult with your syllabus on which procedures you must follow
          for the specific class.
        Openlab Login Problems
        When you login to an ICS host, if you login and get sent back
          to the login screen, then you are either missing system files or you
          are over quota. To check, login to a Windows machine and then use SecureCRT
          to connect to openlab.ics.uci.edu.
        If you can login, then you are probably over quota. Check
            your quota and remove files as necessary. If you cannot login or if you can login but the prompt looks unusual,
            then you are probably missing important files. Please follow the instructions
            on how to Replace UNIX files.

Checking Your Quota
Login to one of the ICS hostsAt the prompt, type in the command quota -vYou will then get a return of something like this:
 An account that is under quota.
suzieanteater% /usr/sbin/quota -vDisk quotas for santeater (uid 1234):Filesystem       usage  quota  limit timeleft  files  quota  limit timeleft/home/santeater   1409   2000   4000            209      0      0
In this example, Suzie Anteater has a quota of 2 MB, and a hard limit of
4 MB. She has used 1.4 MB worth of space and has 209 files in her 
account.
 An account that is over quota.

ICS Research Areas




Curiosity about the world and a commitment to solving problems are the passions that drive ICS faculty. Their research in the information and computer sciences are applicable to many scholarly and scientific fields. But our faculty don't do it alone, students work side-by-side with nationally renowned professors to advance knowledge and improve lives. Below is a list of ICS research areas:
Algorithms and Complexity Bren School faculty members have made significant contributions to many topics in this field, including graph algorithms and graph drawing (computing with systems of pairwise interactions between objects such as web page links, protein interactions, or social networks) and computational geometry (computing with planar or spatial data).
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Research in AI is concerned with producing machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior. Examples include computer vision, bioinformatics, constraint-based problem solving, text understanding, data mining and smart sensor networks.
Biomedical Informatics and Computational Biology  Involves the use of techniques from applied mathematics, informatics, statistics, and computer science to solve biological problems. Current areas of research at the Bren School include medical information access and knowledge representation for health-care guidelines.
Computer Architecture and Design Develops methods and tools for ensuring the reliability and quality of complex, large-scale software systems. These methods and tools support the development, deployment, maintenance and evolution of complex software systems.
Computer Graphics and Visualization Focuses on the field of visual computing that deals with generating/capturing, representing, rendering and interacting with synthetic and real-world images and video. We work on end-to-end solutions from capturing of images and geometry; representing large geometric, image, and video data sets; geometry and image processing; interactive access and rendering of large visual data sets; algorithms for building large area immersive displays for the presentation of visual content; and interation techniques in both small personal displays and in large displays for collaborative environments.
Computer-Supported Cooperative Work Information technologies bring people together -- through social networking, through collaborative systems, through digital media, and through communications. Informatics has been a long-term leader in the study of social engagement through information systems. Topics include distance collaboration, workflow and process-based systems, multi-user gaming, and cultural engagements.
Computer Vision Computer vision at UCI focuses on understanding the information processing capabilities of biological visual systems and on developing computational systems for processing visual media. Research spans both theoretical questions of perception and object representation as well as practical applications ranging from automated surveillance to biological image analysis.?
Databases and Data Mining Focuses on research related to architectures, index structures, algorithms, models, and performance evaluation of a variety of next-generation databases and information systems and technologies for data mining.
Embedded Systems Focuses on issues relating to embedded systems, a special-purpose system in which software and hardware computing elements are completely encapsulated by the device or environment it controls. Unlike a general-purpose computer, such as a personal computer, an embedded system performs pre-defined tasks, usually under very specific constraints (e.g, low power) and requirements (e.g., reliability).?
Environmental Informatics Humanity is currently facing a range of significant environmental challenges such as global warming, species extinction, pollution, and overpopulation. Informatics tools and techniques can help facilitate responses to these challenges, and assist with planning for future environmental issues.?
Human Computer Interaction HCI research at UCI stretches from the architecture of novel interactive systems to the social and cultural considerations of information technology adoption and use. We employ laboratory, ethnographic, and prototyping techniques to understand how people adopt, adapt, and respond to information systems. Recent research has investigated privacy issues in mobile systems, tangible interfaces for group awareness, interactive animation, and visualization of location information.?
Medical Informatics This topic concerns the development and application of information systems to healthcare. Information systems have a critical role to play in contemporary health and wellness programs. This includes technology in hospital settings but also persuasive technologies for healthy living, health care in the home and in the community, and in the interactions between partners in the health care system.?
Multimedia Computing Multimedia computing started receiving attention more than a decade ago.? Naturally, early systems dealt with very limited aspect of multimedia.? With progress in technology, several computing addresses important issues in creation, communication, storage, access, and presentation of information and experiences.? In our department, we are addressing research issues in fundamentals of multimedia systems and their advanced applications.?
Networks and Distributed Systems Researchers investigate various issues in the design and analysis of high-speed networks for multimedia applications. They are actively involved in research on computer networks and distributed systems, with the goal of designing, analyzing and implementing communication systems that allow high-speed transport of multimedia information between end-users.?
Operating Systems?The operating systems area at UCI embraces a wide range of topics related to theory and practice of computer systems software. Researchers here are building systems for reliable and efficient big data processing, mobile I/O virtualization, program analyses and various other applications.
Programming Languages and Systems Systems software research at UCI has expanded to include topics such as program restructuring and transformation techniques for parallelization and distribution, compiler-assisted memory management, component-oriented languages and dynamic code optimization.?
Scientific and Numerical Computing Refers to the application of computers to scientific problems, from astrophysics to zoology. The mode of application can be system modelling, data analysis and mining, or visualization. The focus can be on developing new computational techniques, such as parallel algorithms or new data mining ideas, or on the novel application of existing techniques to new scientific problems.
Security, Privacy and Cryptography Bren School research in this area includes anonymity and authentication in network security, key agreement and digital signatures in cryptography, and security issues in electronic commerce.
Social Informatics UC Irvine is an acknowledged center for the study of social informatics, which incorporates the social and cultural aspects of information technology development and use. Social informatics employs techniques and theories from social sciences and cultural studies to understand the shaping and applications of digital media and their organizational, political, historical, and economic contexts. This topic links information system analysis with design.
Software Engineering Software research at UCI is aimed at creating new software technology and solutions, furthering the information revolution. The central goal of this research is improvement in software development, evolution, deployment, quality, understandability and cost-effectiveness.
Statistics and Statistical Theory Researchers at UCI are concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting empirical data. Statistical principles and methods are important for addressing questions in public policy, medicine, industry and virtually every branch of science.
Ubiquitous Computing Ubiquitous computing builds upon and unites virtually all of thfe current research strengths in the Bren School. Researchers are addressing issues such as context-aware computing, whereby mobile computing responds to one's current context.

  The concept of time is critical in almost all database applications? after all databases store the entities in the

  physical world which is constantly evolving! Yet, basic SQL does not include

  any specific ways of querying over time. Ideally, we would like to be able to

  be able to query to be run on any snapshot of time not just the current time

  (e.g., we should be able to ask a query?what was the average age of

  employees at UCI last year and not just what is the average age of the

  employees at UCI, which is essentially interpreted as a query on the database

  state right now).

  After all

  the database has associated with it a concept of a log which stores

  the whole history of the evolution of the data. So logically we should be

  able to query the database for any instance of time. These set of papers will

  highlight some of the finest progress (and ideas) in thinking, reasoning, and

  support the notion of time in databases. We will explore query languages,

  data models, representation, and also look at some of the implication of

  representing time in databases. The papers we will read are?Rick

  Snodgrass's pick!

  Spatial & Spatio-temporal?Data

  

  Represneting spatial and spatio-temporal data was always important, but has gained

  further importance due to the advances in the web and mapping technologies.

  Database systems have supported spatial extensions and spatial data

  structures (specially through extender technologies)

  for some time now. We will explore the state-of-the-art ideas and main

  concepts in this area. These papers are Shashi

  ?Representing &

  Managing Streaming Data

  

  Streaming data management systems

  change the traditional paradigm of data management wherein data is (mostly)

  static and queries dynamically arrive. In streaming data systems, the queries

  are expected to be static (also known as continuous queries) and data arrives

  dynamically. Streaming data is not a new concept.? e.g., ?pub/sub systems

  and event processing systems of the past (and present) have similar

  characteristics. 

  Many of the technologies query languages,

  processing mechanisms, etc. can (and have been) borrowed in building stream

  management systems. Stream data management systems extend the above work in

  variety of ways more complex query languages which are more expressive

  compared to say languages supported by pub/sub systems, new

  processing/optimization techniques, new approaches to load

  management?e.g., load shedding as a mechanism to achieve cost versus

  quality tradeoff, approximation as a mechanism to achieve scalability, etc.

  Most work on stream data management has been driven from applications such as

  network monitoring, complex analysis on event oriented information, and

  continuous monitoring in adhoc sensor networks. In

  the context of sensor data, additional design constraints

  of sensor battery?preservation has also been extensively studied.

  Techniques such as cost-quality tradeoffs and in-network processing of

  queries have been explored. 

  ?

  Our goal in this class is to

  explore the area of stream data management from the perspective of data model

  and query languages. Specifically, what types of queries are important over

  streaming data and how can query languages be extended to meet the needs of

  stream applications.

					Query and Goal Driven Entity Resolution Framework
				
			

                Overview
                
                  The significance of data quality research is motivated by the observation that
                  the effectiveness of data-driven technologies such as decision support tools,
                  data exploration, analysis, and scientific discovery tools is closely tied to the
                  quality of data on which such techniques are applied. It is well recognized
                  that the outcome of the analysis is only as good as the data on which
                  the analysis is performed. That is why today organizations spend a tangible
                  percent of their budgets on cleaning tasks such as removing duplicates,
                  correcting errors, filling missing values, to improve data quality prior
                  to pushing data through the analysis pipeline.
                  
                  Given the critical importance of the problem, many efforts, in both industry
                  and academia, have explored systematic approaches to addressing the cleaning
                  challenges. The work of our group focuses primarily on the entity resolution challenge
                  that arises because objects in the real world are referred to using references
                  or descriptions that are not always unique identifiers of the objects,
                  leading to ambiguity.
                  
                  The traditional approach for entity resolution uses features associated with
                  a reference (or a record) to find references that co-refer. In our project we are exploring
                  which other sources and types of information could be used, in addition to features, to better
                  disambiguate among references. This information could be present in that data being cleaned itself
                  or can be obtained from external data sources, including ontologies, encyclopedias, and the Web.
                  We are also looking into ways to guide and fine-tune the data cleaning process based
                  on the type of analysis that will be done on the data being cleaned for it to reach higher
                  disambiagution quality as well as efficiency.

Getting Started
Please refer to the Flamingo Getting Started Guide.

Introduction

This release (in C++) includes the source code of several
algorithms for approximate string matching developed at UC Irvine. It
includes algorithms for approximate selection queries, location-based approximate keyword search, 
selectivity
estimation for approximate selection queries, approximate queries on
mixed types, and others.  Although an implementation for approximate
joins is included, the focus of this release is on approximate
selection queries.

Here is a brief explanation of the terms used above:

Approximate String Search: Given a collection of strings and a single string,
how to find those strings in the collection that are "similar to" the
given string? 

This functionality is implemented by the modules
Common, 
FilterTree,
Listmerger, 
StringMap,
and
PartEnum.  
We recommend getting started with
the FilterTree module for this purpose.

Selectivity Estimation for Approximate String Search: Given
a collection of strings and a single string, how can we estimate the
number of strings that are "similar to" the given string?  This
functionality is implemented in the SEPIA module.

Approximate String Join: Given two collections of strings (possibly the same
collection), how to find those pairs of strings that are "similar to"
each other?

Location-Based Approximate Keyword Search: Given a collection of spatial objects with 
descriptive keywords, find those objects within a given spatial region 
that have a given set of keywords. 
In addition, the keywords don't need to match exactly, but approximately.

This functionality is implemented by the module:
LBAK-Tree
  

There are various string similarity functions, such as 
Levenshtein Distance (aka the Edit Distance),

Jaccard Similarity,
Cosine Similarity, and 
Dice
Similarity.  The following is a description of the modules
corresponding to the source directory structure:

Common: This module contains classes for supporting 
the following similarity functions / distance measures: 
Levenshtein Distance (aka Edit Distance), Jaccard Similarity, Cosine Similarity, Dice Similarity. It also
provides functionality for decomposing strings into grams.

FilterTree: This module provides functionality for approximate string search
using an inverted-list index. Furthermore, 
query performance can be improved by adding filters, i.e. partitioning the string collection into 
disjoint subsets according to some property (e.g. the length of the strings). 
The use of filters is facilitated by a hierarchical structure (the FilterTree), 
in which each level in the tree corresponds to one filter. 
We have implemented the length and charsum filter. This package contains three flavors of indexes: 
in-memory indexes compressed & uncompressed and a disk-based index.

ListMerger: Answering approximate string queries based on an inverted-list index 
requires finding elements that occur at least T times on the inverted lists belonging 
to the grams in the query string (T depends on the similarity metric and the similarity threshold). 
This problem is commonly referred to as the T-occurrence problem.
This module implements several algorithms for solving the T-occurrence problem
as described in "Efficient Merging and Filtering Algorithms for Approximate String Searches",
Chen Li, Jiaheng Lu and Yiming Lu, ICDE 2008.
In addition, we have implemented efficient algorithms for disk-based indexes.

MAT-Tree: MAT-tree is an indexing structure to support
queries on data with an approximate string predicate and a numeric
predicate.  A typical query is: "Find employee records whose name is
similar to Speilberg and whose age is close to 45."  The indexing
structure is proposed in the following paper: "Indexing Mixed Types
for Approximate Retrieval," Liang Jin, Nick Koudas, Chen Li, Anthony
K.H. Tung, VLDB 2005, Trondheim, Norway.

SEPIA: This technique solves the problem of estimating the
selectivity of an approximate string predicate.  It can answer
questions such as: "From a collection of strings, how many of them
have an edit distance within 3 to a given string?".  Such information
can be used in optimizing queries of approximate string matching.  The
technique was published in the paper: "Selectivity Estimation for Fuzzy
String Predicates in Large Data Sets," Liang Jin and Chen Li, VLDB
2005, Trondheim, Norway.

StringMap: This algorithm maps strings from the
edit-distance metric space to a high-dimensional Euclidean space, and
uses a multi-dimensional indexing structure to answer approximate
queries.  The algorithm is published in the paper: "Efficient Record
Linkage in Large Data Sets," by Liang Jin, Chen Li, and Sharad
Mehrotra, in 8th International Conference on Database Systems for
Advanced Applications (DASFAA) 2003, Kyoto, Japan.

PartEnum: This algorithm is published in the paper:
"Efficient Exact Set-Similarity Joins," Arvind Arasu, Venkatesh Ganti,
Raghav Kaushik, VLDB 2006.  We implemented the algorithm to
support approximate string matching queries, excluding approximate joins.

TopK: This package contains algorithms for efficient Top-K approximate string search.

LBAK-Tree: This module implements 
location-based approximate keyword search as described in 
"Supporting Location-Based Approximate Keyword Search", by Sattam Alsubaiee, Alexander Behm and Chen Li.
It enhances an R*-Tree with inverted indexes for approximate selection queries. It implements various 
algorithms for choosing R*-Tree nodes to place inverted indexes in.
The FilterTree module is used to provide the inverted indexes for approximate selection queries.


In addition, we have provided some commonly used functions in the
util directory.



Changes in Version 4.0 (compared to Version 3.0)

Added LBAK-Tree for location-based approximate keyword search from:  
"Supporting Location-Based Approximate Keyword Search", 
by Sattam Alsubaiee, Alexander Behm and Chen Li, ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS 2010
Major performance improvements for approximate selection queries
Added insert/delete functionality for in-memory inverted indexes
Added support for 64-bit operating systems
Switched to CMake build system

This release (in C++) includes the source code of several
algorithms for approximate string matching.  They include algorithms
of our recently published papers, an algorithm of our ongoing work, 
and an algorithm invented by Microsoft Researchers
in a paper published in VLDB 2006.

The motivation of this research is to efficiently answer the
following two types of approximate string queries:

Search: Given a collection of strings and a single string,
how to find those strings in the collection that are "similar to" the
given string?

Join: Given two collections of strings (possibly the same
collection), how to find those pairs of strings that are "similar to"
each other?
  

There are various string similarity functions, such as 
edit
distance, jaccard, and cosine.  The following is the list of
algorithms corresponding to the source directory structure:

MAT-Tree: MAT-tree is an indexing structure to support
queries on data with an approximate string predicate and a numeric
predicate.  A typical query is: "Find employee records whose name is
similar to Speilberg and whose age is close to 45."  The indexing
structure is proposed in the following paper: "Indexing Mixed Types
for Approximate Retrieval," Liang Jin, Nick Koudas, Chen Li, Anthony
K.H. Tung, VLDB 2005, Trondheim, Norway.

SEPIA: This technique solves the problem of estimating the
selectivity of an approximate string predicate.  It can answer
questions such as: "From a collection of strings, how many of them
have an edit distance within 3 to a given string?".  Such information
can be used in optimizing queries of approximate string matching.  The
technique was published the paper: "Selectivity Estimation for Fuzzy
String Predicates in Large Data Sets," Liang Jin and Chen Li, VLDB
2005, Trondheim, Norway.

StringMap: This algorithm maps strings from the
edit-distance metric place to a high-dimensional Euclidean space, and
uses a multi-dimensional indexing structure to answer approximate
queries.  The algorithm is published in the paper: "Efficient Record
Linkage in Large Data Sets," by Liang Jin, Chen Li, and Sharad
Mehrotra, in 8th International Conference on Database Systems for
Advanced Applications (DASFAA) 2003, Kyoto, Japan.

FilterTree: This is a new algorithm we are
developing to support approximate string queries using a tree
structure.

PartEnum: This algorithm is published in the paper:
"Efficient Exact Set-Similarity Joins," Arvind Arasu, Venkatesh Ganti,
Raghav Kaushik, VLDB 2006.  We implemented the algorithm to
support approximate selection queries.



In addition, we have provided some commonly used functions in the
"util" directory.

Introduction

This release (in C++) includes the source code of several
algorithms for approximate string matching developed at UC Irvine. It
includes algorithms for approximate selection queries, selectivity
estimation for approximate selection queries, approximate queries on
mixed types, and others.  Although an implementation for approximate
joins is included, the focus of this release is on approximate
selection queries.

Here is a brief explanation of the terms used above:

Approximate String Search: Given a collection of strings and a single string,
how to find those strings in the collection that are "similar to" the
given string? 

This functionality is implemented by the modules
Common, 
FilterTree,
Listmerger, 
StringMap,
and
PartEnum.  
We recommend getting started with
the FilterTree module for this purpose.

Selectivity Estimation for Approximate String Search: Given
a collection of strings and a single string, how can we estimate the
number of strings that are "similar to" the given string?  This
functionality is implemented in the SEPIA module.

Approximate String Join: Given two collections of strings (possibly the same
collection), how to find those pairs of strings that are "similar to"
each other?
  

There are various string similarity functions, such as 
Levenshtein Distance (aka the Edit Distance),

Jaccard Similarity,
Cosine Similarity, and 
Dice
Similarity.  The following is a description of the modules
corresponding to the source directory structure:

Common: This module contains classes for supporting 
the following similarity functions / distance measures: 
Levenshtein Distance (aka Edit Distance), Jaccard Similarity, Cosine Similarity, Dice Similarity. It also
provides functionality for decomposing strings into grams.

FilterTree: This module provides functionality for approximate string search
using an inverted-list index. Furthermore, 
query performance can be improved by adding filters, i.e. partitioning the string collection into 
disjoint subsets according to some property (e.g. the length of the strings). 
The use of filters is facilitated by a hierarchical structure (the FilterTree), 
in which each level in the tree corresponds to one filter. 
We have implemented the length and checksum filter. 

ListMerger: Answering approximate string queries based on an inverted-list index 
requires finding elements that occur at least T times on the inverted lists belonging 
to the grams in the query string (T depends on the similarity metric and the similarity threshold). 
This problem is commonly referred to as the T-occurrence problem.
This module implements several algorithms for solving the T-occurrence problem
as described in "Efficient Merging and Filtering Algorithms for Approximate String Searches",
Chen Li, Jiaheng Lu and Yiming Lu, ICDE 2008.

MAT-Tree: MAT-tree is an indexing structure to support
queries on data with an approximate string predicate and a numeric
predicate.  A typical query is: "Find employee records whose name is
similar to Speilberg and whose age is close to 45."  The indexing
structure is proposed in the following paper: "Indexing Mixed Types
for Approximate Retrieval," Liang Jin, Nick Koudas, Chen Li, Anthony
K.H. Tung, VLDB 2005, Trondheim, Norway.

Sepia: This technique solves the problem of estimating the
selectivity of an approximate string predicate.  It can answer
questions such as: "From a collection of strings, how many of them
have an edit distance within 3 to a given string?".  Such information
can be used in optimizing queries of approximate string matching.  The
technique was published in the paper: "Selectivity Estimation for Fuzzy
String Predicates in Large Data Sets," Liang Jin and Chen Li, VLDB
2005, Trondheim, Norway.

StringMap: This algorithm maps strings from the
edit-distance metric space to a high-dimensional Euclidean space, and
uses a multi-dimensional indexing structure to answer approximate
queries.  The algorithm is published in the paper: "Efficient Record
Linkage in Large Data Sets," by Liang Jin, Chen Li, and Sharad
Mehrotra, in 8th International Conference on Database Systems for
Advanced Applications (DASFAA) 2003, Kyoto, Japan.

PartEnum: This algorithm is published in the paper:
"Efficient Exact Set-Similarity Joins," Arvind Arasu, Venkatesh Ganti,
Raghav Kaushik, VLDB 2006.  We implemented the algorithm to
support approximate string matching queries, excluding approximate joins.



In addition, we have provided some commonly used functions in the
util directory.



Changes in Version 2.0

The code design of filtertree has been completely re-worked.
Added separate module listmerger, which implements various list-merging algorithms.
Added support for Jaccard, Cosine and Dice similarity functions.
Moved gram generators and similarity functions to "common" module.
Due to the new design, we removed the positional filter but added the checksum filter.
Several bugfixes in all modules.

TopK: This package contains algorithms for efficient Top-K approximate string search.



In addition, we have provided some commonly used functions in the
util directory.

        	Overview
            Welcome to the new home of the AsterixDB Big Data Management
            System (BDMS). The AsterixDB BDMS is the result of about 3.5 years
            of R&D involving researchers at UC Irvine, UC Riverside, and UC San
            Diego. The AsterixDB code base now consists of roughly 250K lines
            of Java code that has been co-developed at UC Irvine and UC
            Riverside.
            
            Initiated in 2009, the NSF-sponsored ASTERIX project has been
            developing new technologies for ingesting, storing, managing,
            indexing, querying, and analyzing vast quantities of
            semi-structured information. The project has been combining ideas
            from three distinct areas¡ªsemi-structured data, parallel databases,
            and data-intensive computing (a.k.a. today¡¯s Big Data platforms)¡ªin
            order to create a next-generation, open-source software platform
            that scales by running on large, shared-nothing commodity computing
            clusters.

            The ASTERIX effort has been targeting a wide range of
            semi-structured information, ranging from ¡°data¡± use cases¡ªwhere
            information is well-typed and highly regular¡ªto ¡°content¡± use
            cases¡ªwhere data tends to be irregular, much of each datum may be
            textual, and the ultimate schema for the various data types
            involved may be hard to anticipate up front. The ASTERIX project
            has been addressing technical issues including highly scalable data
            storage and indexing, semi-structured query processing on very
            large clusters, and merging time-tested parallel database
            techniques with modern data-intensive computing techniques to
            support performant yet declarative solutions to the problem of
            storing and analyzing semi-structured information effectively.
            
            The first fruits of this labor have been captured in the
            AsterixDB system that is now being released in preliminary or
            ¡°Beta¡± release form. We are hoping that the arrival of AsterixDB
            will mark the beginning of the ¡°BDMS era¡±, and we hope that both
            the Big Data community and the database community will find the
            AsterixDB system to be interesting and useful for a much broader
            class of problems than can be addressed with any one of today¡¯s
            current Big Data platforms and related technologies (e.g., Hadoop,
            Pig, Hive, HBase, MongoDB, and so on). One of our project mottos
            has been ¡°one size fits a bunch¡±¡ªat least that has been our
            aim.

What Is AsterixDB? [Back to TOC]
In a nutshell, AsterixDB is a full-function BDMS (Big Data Management System) with a rich feature set that distinguishes it from pretty much any other Big Data platform that¡¯s out and available today. We believe that its feature set makes it well-suited to modern needs such as web data warehousing and social data storage and analysis. AsterixDB has:

A semistructured NoSQL style data model (ADM) resulting from extending JSON with object database ideasAn expressive and declarative query language (AQL) that supports a broad range of queries and analysis over semistructured dataA parallel runtime query execution engine, Hyracks, that has been scale-tested on up to 1000+ cores and 500+ disksPartitioned LSM-based data storage and indexing to support efficient ingestion and management of semistructured dataSupport for query access to externally stored data (e.g., data in HDFS) as well as to data stored natively by AsterixDBA rich set of primitive data types, including spatial and temporal data in addition to integer, floating point, and textual dataSecondary indexing options that include B+ trees, R trees, and inverted keyword (exact and fuzzy) index typesSupport for fuzzy and spatial queries as well as for more traditional parametric queriesBasic transactional (concurrency and recovery) capabilities akin to those of a NoSQL store

Getting and Using AsterixDB [Back to TOC]
You are most likely here because you are interested in getting your hands on AsterixDB¡ªso you would like to know how to get it, how to set it up, and how to use it. The following is a list of the supporting documents that we have available today:


Installing AsterixDB using Managix : This is our installation guide, and it is where you should start. This document will tell you how to obtain, install, and manage instances of AsterixDB, including both single-machine setup (for developers) as well as cluster installations (for deployment in its intended form).
AsterixDB 101: An ADM and AQL Primer : This is a first-timers introduction to the user model of the AsterixDB BDMS, by which we mean the view of AsterixDB as seen from the perspective of an ¡°average user¡± or Big Data application developer. The AsterixDB user model consists of its data modeling features (ADM) and its query capabilities (AQL). This document presents a tiny ¡°social data warehousing¡± example and uses it as a backdrop for describing, by example, the key features of AsterixDB. By working through this document, you will learn how to define the artifacts needed to manage data in AsterixDB, how to load data into the system, how to use most of the basic features of its query language, and how to insert and delete data dynamically.
Asterix Data Model (ADM), Asterix Functions, Asterix functions for Allen¡¯s Relations, and Asterix Query Language (AQL) : These are reference documents that catalog the primitive data types and built-in functions available in AQL and the reference manual for AQL itself.
REST API to AsterixDB : Access to data in an AsterixDB instance is provided via a REST-based API. This is a short document that describes the REST API entry points and their URL syntax.
To all who have now come this far: Thanks for your interest in AsterixDB, and for kicking its tires in its Beta form. In addition to getting the system and trying it out, please sign up as a member of the AsterixDB user mailing list (asterixdb-users (at) googlegroups.com) so that you can contact us easily with your questions, issues, and other feedback. We want AsterixDB to be a ¡°big hit¡± some day, and we are anxious to see what users do with it and to learn from that feedback what we should be working on most urgently in the next phase of the project.

  Applications
    requiring voice and data, as well as video, are rapidly expanding and  future
    communication services must be able to facilitate a wide variety of diversified
    services in a practical and easily expandable fashion. 
Bren School  researchers investigate
            various issues in the design and analysis of high-speed networks for multimedia
            applications. They are  actively involved in research on computer
            networks and distributed systems, with the goal of designing, analyzing and
            implementing communication systems that allow high-speed transport of multimedia
            information between end-users. 
Research collectively addresses a complete view
            of the communications network, from the network substrate (high-speed networks,
            ATM networks, wireless networks), to end-to-end protocols support and communication
            subsystem architectures (Object-Oriented frameworks), to distributed applications
            (multimedia distance learning applications). 
In the area of distributed systems,
            researchers are developing new programming paradigms for distributed systems
            based on the principle of autonomous messages, which achieves speed-up through
            parallel processing, and permits interactive open-ended applications through
            dynamic functional composition.

UC Irvine is an acknowledged center for the study of social 
informatics, which incorporates the social and cultural aspects of
             information technology development and use. 

          Social informatics employs techniques and theories from 
social sciences and cultural studies to understand the shaping and
             applications of digital media and their organizational, 
political, historical, and economic contexts. 

          This topic links information system analysis with design.?
